## **Why Gartner’s Recognition Matters**

Gartner’s Hype Cycle report is a well-known way to see how mature and widely adopted a technology is. The fact that CDEs have been recognized for three years shows that they’ve gone from being a new idea to a must-have for many companies. 

This recognition helps companies understand that CDEs are becoming more important in software development.

The Hype Cycle follows technologies from their start to when they’re commonly used. CDEs being in this cycle for three years shows that they’re becoming more common in how companies work. 

As businesses look for ways to help their developers be more productive and simplify how they work, CDEs provide a solution that fits these needs.

## **Why More Companies Are Using CDEs**

CDEs offer a reliable, scalable, and secure environment for developing software, solving many of the problems that come with traditional setups. 

One of the main [reasons companies are adopting CDEs](https://www.daytona.io/dotfiles/the-rise-of-cloud-development-environments) is because they provide a standard environment that’s the same for all teams and locations. This uniformity reduces mistakes, improves teamwork, and speeds up the development process.

Gartner’s recognition of CDEs fits with the trend of more companies using cloud-based tools. [Gartner predicts](https://www.gitpod.io/blog/gartner-2023-cde-hypecycle) that by 2026, 60% of cloud work will involve CDEs, showing that these environments are becoming a key part of how modern development is done. 

CDEs can easily grow with a company’s needs, integrate new technologies, and keep everything secure, making them an attractive option for companies that want to stay competitive.

### **Key Benefits of CDEs**

Some key advantages of CDE:

* **Consistency Across Teams:** CDEs provide a standardized development environment, reducing errors and ensuring all team members work in the same setup, regardless of location.  
* **Scalability:** Easily adaptable to a company's growing needs, CDEs can scale up resources or integrate new technologies seamlessly.  
* **Enhanced Collaboration:** CDEs support real-time collaboration, enabling distributed teams to work together more efficiently, leading to faster delivery of features.  
* **Cost Efficiency:** By reducing infrastructure costs and improving resource allocation, CDEs help organizations optimize their budgets.  
* **Security:** Built-in security features in CDEs protect sensitive data, ensuring compliance with industry standards.

These qualities are a perfect fit for the requirements of contemporary software development, which explains the growing interest in CDEs.

## **What’s New in CDEs**

CDEs have been getting better all the time, with new features and capabilities added to meet the changing needs of development teams. Recent improvements include tools for better collaboration, instant workspaces, and AI-driven code suggestions. 

These upgrades help developers be more productive, work smoothly, and get their jobs done no matter where they are.

One big change in CDEs is the use of AI and machine learning. These technologies help CDEs offer smart code suggestions, automatic testing, and predictions that help developers write better code more quickly and with fewer mistakes. 

As AI keeps improving, it will likely become even more important in CDEs, making development teams even more effective.

## **How Enterprises Are Using CDEs**
