## What is Jupyter Notebook?

Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents (called [notebooks](/definitions/notebook.md)) that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It supports multiple programming languages, with [Python](/definitions/python.md) being the most popular.

### Key Components of Jupyter Notebook

- **Notebook Interface**: Where you write and execute code, view outputs, and add explanations.
- **Cells**: Individual units in a notebook that can contain code, text, or other content.
- **[Kernel](/definitions/kernel.md)**: The computational engine that executes the code contained in a notebook.

## How Does Jupyter Notebook Work?

Jupyter Notebook operates on a client-server model:

1. A Jupyter server runs in the background on your local machine or a remote server.
2. You connect to the server by opening a specific URL in your web browser.
3. Through the browser interface, you can create new notebooks and insert code, text, visuals, or links as needed.
4. When you execute code, it's sent to the kernel for processing.
5. Results are returned to the browser for display.

This architecture allows for interactive coding sessions where you can see results immediately and iterate quickly.

**Key Point:** Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb files) contain both the input and output of your interactive sessions, making them excellent for sharing and reproducing work.

### Sharing Notebooks

You can share your notebooks in two main ways:
1. Download the notebook as a raw .ipynb file, which others can open on their own Jupyter server.
2. Share the URL directly with users who have access to the same server. (Note: To enable real-time collaboration via URL sharing, Jupyter must be run using the --collaborative flag.)

## Getting Started with Jupyter Notebook in Daytona

### Installation Guide

Daytona makes it easy to set up Jupyter Notebook in your development environment. Here's how to get started:

1. **System Requirements**:
   - Daytona account
   - Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Safari recommended)

2. **Installation Steps**:
   - Log in to your Daytona account
   - Create a new project or open an existing one
   - In the project settings, enable Jupyter Notebook support
   - Daytona will automatically set up the necessary environment

### Dev Container Configuration for Jupyter Notebook in Daytona

Daytona leverages dev containers to provide a consistent and reproducible development environment for Jupyter Notebook. This integration ensures that your Jupyter setup is identical across different machines and team members. Here's how to configure it:

1. In your Daytona project, navigate to the `.devcontainer` folder (or create it if it doesn't exist).
2. Add or modify the `devcontainer.json` file with the following content:

```json
{
    "name": "Jupyter Notebook in Daytona",
    "image": "jupyter/datascience-notebook",
    "forwardPorts": [8888],
    "postCreateCommand": "pip install --user -r requirements.txt",
    "extensions": [
        "ms-python.python",
        "ms-toolsai.jupyter"
    ],
    "settings": {
        "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "/opt/conda/bin/python"
    }
}
```

3. Create a `requirements.txt` file in your project root to specify any additional Python packages you need.

Here's an example of what your `requirements.txt` might look like for this basic setup:

```txt
numpy==1.21.0
matplotlib==3.4.2
pandas==1.3.0
scikit-learn==0.24.2
```

This `requirements.txt` includes some common libraries used in data science projects. You can modify this list based on your specific project needs.

This configuration does the following:
- Uses the official Jupyter Docker image, which Daytona will automatically pull and set up.
- Forwards port 8888, allowing you to access Jupyter Notebook in your browser.
- Installs project-specific dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
- Adds useful VS Code extensions for Python and Jupyter development.
- Sets the default Python interpreter to the one provided in the Jupyter image.

By using this dev container setup in Daytona, you ensure that everyone working on the project has the same Jupyter environment, reducing "it works on my machine" issues and streamlining collaboration.

**Note**: Daytona handles the process of building and running the dev container, so you don't need to manually manage Docker. Simply push these configuration files to your project repository, and Daytona will take care of the rest when you or your team members access the project.

### Creating and Running Your First Notebook

Once Jupyter Notebook is set up in your Daytona environment or dev container, follow these steps to create and run your first notebook:

1. **Set Up Project Structure**:
   Create a basic project structure in your Daytona workspace:

   ```
   my_jupyter_project/
   ├── .devcontainer/
   │   └── devcontainer.json
   ├── notebooks/
   │   └── first_notebook.ipynb
   ├── data/
   │   └── sample_data.csv
   ├── requirements.txt
   └── README.md
   ```

   This structure keeps your notebooks, data, and configuration separate. The `requirements.txt` file lists the Python packages needed for your project.

2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   - In your Daytona project or dev container, open a terminal and navigate to the `my_jupyter_project` folder
   - Run `jupyter notebook`
   - This will start the Jupyter server and open the dashboard in your default web browser

3. **Create a New Notebook**:
   - In the Jupyter dashboard, navigate to the `notebooks` folder
   - Click the "New" button and select "Python 3" (or your preferred kernel)
   - A new notebook will open in a separate tab
   - Save the notebook as `first_notebook.ipynb`

4. **Basic Operations**:
   - **Adding a Code Cell**: Click the "+" button in the toolbar
   - **Running a Cell**: Select the cell and click the "Run" button or use Shift+Enter
   - **Changing Cell Type**: Use the dropdown in the toolbar to switch between code and markdown

Here's a simple example to try in your first notebook:

```python
# This is a code cell
print("Hello, Jupyter!")

# Let's do some simple math
result = 5 + 3
print(f"5 + 3 = {result}")

# Import a library and create a simple plot
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = np.sin(x)
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title("Sine Wave")
plt.show()
```

After running this cell, you should see the output and a sine wave plot directly below it.
