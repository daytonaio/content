# Introducing Daytona Project Config: Simplify and Streamline Workspace Setup

## Introduction

Developing similar [development environments](/definitions/20240819_definition_development%20environment.md) for different projects can often be boring and time-consuming. Each time you begin a new project or adjust a new [workspace](/definitions/20240819_definition_daytona%20workspace.md), you probably recreate [repository](/definitions/20240819_definition_repository.md), environment variables, and build settings by hand. The more complex your projects are, the more these overhead tasks hinder your productivity.

You can automate all those processes and even keep the whole consistency throughout your workspaces by using Project Configs. They were introduced in [v0.24.0](<https://github.com/daytonaio/daytona/releases/tag/v0.24.0>). It enables you to predefine project settings .

### TL;DR

- **What are Project Configs?** Preset workspace parameters to save down on setup time.
- **Why use them?** they reduce setup time and are prefered by power users 
- **Key Features:** They use the KEY=VALUE syntax to enclose your project's environment variables, 
build parameters (devcontainer.json), and Git URL.
- **Future Development:** Project Configs will soon integrate with
[Prebuilds](<https://www.daytona.io/docs/usage/prebuilds>)
, enhancing workspace readiness.

## What Is a Project-Config ?

A project configuration contains all necessary properties to define and manage projects within a [Workspace](/definitions/20240819_definition_daytona%20workspace.md). It stores information such as the [repository URL](/definitions/20240819_definition_repository.md), build configuration, and environment variables. This allows for easy reuse of previously set configurations, ensuring a consistent and reproducible setup across multiple Workspaces.

**What makes this significant?**

Maintaining a consistent [development environment](/definitions/20240819_definition_development%20environment.md) is crucial for developers managing several projects or working in teams in order to prevent problems like inconsistent build procedures, missing dependencies, and version mismatches. In addition to saving time, project configurations provide reproducible and consistent environments.

### Key Features of a Project-Config

A project configuration encapsulates all the essential elements for setting up a project, including:

#### Repository URL
The URL of the Git repository associated with the Project.

#### Build Configuration
- **[Automatic](<https://www.daytona.io/docs/usage/builders#automatic>)**: Auto-detects the most appropriate Builder for your project.
- **[Devcontainer](<https://www.daytona.io/docs/usage/builders#dev-container>)**: Utilizes a predefined development container specified by a `devcontainer.json` file.
- **[Custom image](<https://www.daytona.io/docs/usage/builders#custom-image>)**: Builds the Project image by specifying a custom base container.
- **[None](<https://www.daytona.io/docs/usage/builders#none>)**: Builds a Project by using the default base image (`daytonaio/workspace-project`).

#### Environment Variables
Environment variables are specified in the `KEY=VALUE` format. These variables are essential for the Project’s build and runtime environments. You can set the variables directly or pass them from the machine’s environment during execution.

#### Project Configuration Name
A unique identifier for the Project Configuration, which distinguishes it from other configurations within the system.

With the `daytona project-config` command, you can add, view, update, list, set as default, or delete Project Configurations, giving you full control over the configuration and reuse of your Project setups across different Workspaces.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Creating a New Project Config

Let's dive into the actual process of creating a Project Config in Daytona. Here's
how you can get started:

### 1. Add a New Project Config

Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
daytona project-config add
```

You'll be prompted to enter key information for the configuration, such as the
[repository URL](/definitions/20240819_definition_repository.md), build
configuration, and environment variables.

For example:

```bash
daytona project-config add
> Enter repository URL: https://github.com/user/repo
> Select build configuration: Devcontainer
> Enter environment variables: ENV_VAR=production
> Name your project config: MyProjectConfig
```

This simple set of inputs ensures that the next time you create a workspace,
Daytona will automatically load these settings, significantly reducing setup time.

### 2. Sample Repository for Project Config

Let's set up a Project Config for a
[TypeScript Node Project](<https://github.com/daytonaio/sample-typescript-node>)
, which includes a basic Node.js app and a `devcontainer.json`
for an easy development setup.

Here's how to create the Project Config:

```bash
daytona project-config add
> Enter repository URL: https://github.com/daytonaio/sample-typescript-node
> Select build configuration: Devcontainer
> Enter environment variables: NODE_ENV=development
> Name your project config: TypeScript-Node
```
<img src='assets/20240910_Daytona_Project_Config_add.png'/>

Once saved, you can apply this configuration to multiple workspaces, ensuring that
each workspace has the same repository and environment setup. To create a new
workspace with this setup, use:

```bash
daytona create
> Select project config: TypeScript-Node
```

This process will quickly set up your workspace with the same configuration, making
it easy to get started.

## Managing Your Project Configs

Once you've created a Project Config, Daytona provides several commands to manage
and view these configurations. You can explore these commands in more detail in the
[Daytona CLI Reference](<https://www.daytona.io/docs/reference/cli/#daytona-project-config>).

### Listing All Project Configs

To list all your existing Project Configs, use the command:

```bash
daytona project-config list
```

This will display a table with the Project Config name, associated repository,
build configuration, and whether it's set as the default.

<img src='assets/20240910_Daytona_Project_Config_list.png'/>

### Viewing Details of a Project Config

To see the details of a specific Project Config, run:

```bash
daytona project-config info
```

Select the configuration you want to view, and Daytona will display details about
the repository URL, build configuration, and any environment variables associated
with it. For example, you might see information like this:

```bash
Project Config Info:
---------------------
Name: sample-typescript-node
Repository: https://github.com/daytonaio/sample-typescript-node.git
Default: Yes
Build: Devcontainer
Devcontainer path: .devcontainer/devcontainer.json
```

This output provides a structured view of the Project Config, showing key details
such as the repository URL, build configuration, and the path to the development
container configuration.

---

## Updating or Deleting Project Configs

### Updating a Project Config

If you need to change settings within an existing Project Config, Daytona makes it
easy. Simply run:

```bash
daytona project-config update
```

You'll be prompted to select the Project Config you want to update and then modify
any of the settings, such as changing the repository URL or adding new environment
variables.

### Deleting a Project Config

If a configuration is no longer needed, you can remove it using the following
command:

```bash
daytona project-config delete
```

This will remove the configuration from Daytona, ensuring your workspace remains
clean and organized.

## What's Next: Project Configs and Prebuilds

The introduction of Project Configs is part of Daytona's broader initiative to
improve developer efficiency by automating repetitive tasks. One upcoming feature
that will further streamline the development process is **Prebuilds**.

### How Prebuilds Will Enhance Project Configs

Prebuilds allow for even faster workspace setup by listening for changes in the
underlying repository and automatically running builds in the background. This
ensures that when a developer creates a new workspace, all necessary builds have
already been completed, significantly reducing wait times.

> **"Prebuilds are designed to take Daytona's automation to the next level,
> allowing for 'ready-to-go' environments. Coupled with Project Configs, they'll
> make workspace creation nearly instantaneous."** – Daytona Engineering Team

## Conclusion

Daytona's **Project Configs** streamline workspace setup by
reducing the time and effort needed to configure repositories, environment
variables, and build settings. Whether you're a solo developer or part of a larger
team, the ability to define and reuse configurations can dramatically enhance your
productivity.

As Daytona continues to roll out features like **Prebuilds**, the development
experience will only get faster and more efficient, allowing developers to spend
less time on setup and more time coding.
