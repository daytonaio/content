# Using Fly Provider in Daytona: A Comprehensive Guide

# Introduction

Daytona has introduced a powerful new provider that enables developers to seamlessly create and manage workspace projects using Fly.io's virtual machines (Fly Machines). This integration bridges the gap between local development and cloud deployment, offering developers a streamlined workflow for managing cloud resources. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about setting up and utilizing the Fly Provider, from initial installation to troubleshooting common issues.

## What is the Fly Provider?

The Fly Provider is an integration that connects Daytona with Fly.io's global
network of low-latency edge servers. This powerful combination offers several
key benefits:

- **Global Deployment**: Deploy workspaces to any of Fly.io's worldwide
  locations
- **Edge Computing**: Leverage Fly.io's distributed infrastructure for better
  performance
- **Simplified Management**: Manage your cloud resources through Daytona's
  familiar interface
- **Cost-Effective**: Pay only for the resources you use with Fly.io's
  usage-based pricing
- **Developer-Friendly**: Maintain your existing workflow while gaining cloud
  capabilities

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- **Daytona v0.25.2 or later** installed on your system
- An active **Fly.io account** with API access
- The **Fly CLI** installed
  ([Installation Guide](https://fly.io/docs/flyctl/install/))
- Basic familiarity with command-line operations
- Sufficient permissions to create and manage Fly Machines
## Installation and Setup

### 1. Installing the Fly Provider

Start by installing the Fly Provider using the Daytona CLI:

```bash
daytona provider install
```

You'll see a list of available providers. Use the arrow keys to select
`fly-provider`:

### 2. Provider Configuration

The configuration process involves several steps to set up your Fly.io
integration.

#### Step 1: Initialize Target Setup

Run the following command to begin target configuration:

```bash
daytona target set
```

#### Step 4: Configure Fly.io Details

Enter your Fly.io configuration details when prompted. You'll need to provide:

- Organization name
- API token
- Default region (optional)

#### Step 5 : Verify your target with

```bash
daytona target list
```

### 3. Creating Your First Workspace

Create a new workspace using the following command:

```bash
daytona create --provider fly --name my-fly-workspace
```

This command initiates the creation of a new workspace on Fly.io. You can customize the deployment with additional flags:

```bash
daytona create --provider fly --name my-fly-workspace --region lhr --size performance-2x
```

## Managing Workspaces

### Basic Operations

#### Deployment
```bash
daytona deploy --provider fly --name my-fly-workspace
```

#### Listing Workspaces

```bash
daytona list --provider fly
```

#### Stopping a Workspace

```bash
daytona stop --provider fly --name my-fly-workspace
```

#### Deleting a Workspace

```bash
daytona delete --provider fly --name my-fly-workspace
```

### Advanced Operations

#### Custom Machine Configurations
```bash
daytona create --provider fly --name custom-workspace \
  --size performance-4x \
  --region fra \
  --volume-size 50
```

#### Working with Multiple Regions
```bash
daytona create --provider fly --name multi-region-workspace \
  --regions "lhr,fra,dfw" \
  --size performance-2x
```

### Best Practices

1. **Resource Management**

   - Monitor your resource usage regularly
   - Start with smaller instances and scale up as needed
   - Clean up unused workspaces promptly
   - Use appropriate machine sizes for your workload
   - Consider regional pricing differences

2. **Security**

   - Rotate your API keys periodically
   - Use minimal required permissions for your API tokens
   - Keep your Fly CLI and Daytona installations updated
   - Implement proper access controls
   - Regularly audit your workspace configurations

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Choose regions closest to your team
   - Use appropriate machine sizes
   - Monitor resource utilization
   - Implement caching when possible
   - Regular maintenance and updates

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Authentication Issues

**Problem**: API authentication failures  
**Solution**:

- Verify your API key's validity
- Check API key permissions
- Ensure your Fly.io account is active
- Validate your authentication configuration
- Check for any account billing issues

### Deployment Failures

**Problem**: Workspace fails to deploy  
**Solution**:

- Check resource allocation
- Verify account status
- Review deployment logs
- Ensure compatible region selection
- Validate network configurations
- Check for conflicting workspace names
- Verify machine size availability

### Scaling Problems

**Problem**: Unable to scale workspaces  
**Solution**:
- Review account resource limits
- Check for region-specific constraints
- Verify machine type compatibility
- Monitor billing status
- Check for regional capacity
- Validate scaling configurations

### Network Issues

**Problem**: Connectivity problems  
**Solution**:

- Check Fly.io status page
