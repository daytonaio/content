# Using Fly Provider in Daytona: A Comprehensive Guide

# Introduction

Daytona has introduced a powerful new provider that enables developers to
seamlessly create and manage workspace projects using Fly.io's virtual machines
(Fly Machines). This integration bridges the gap between local development and
cloud deployment, offering developers a streamlined workflow for managing cloud
resources.

## What is the Fly Provider?

The Fly Provider is an integration that connects Daytona with Fly.io's global
network of low-latency edge servers. This powerful combination offers several
key benefits:

- **Global Deployment**: Deploy workspaces to any of Fly.io's worldwide
  locations
- **Edge Computing**: Leverage Fly.io's distributed infrastructure for better
  performance
- **Simplified Management**: Manage your cloud resources through Daytona's
  familiar interface
- **Cost-Effective**: Pay only for the resources you use with Fly.io's
  usage-based pricing
- **Developer-Friendly**: Maintain your existing workflow while gaining cloud
  capabilities

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- The latest version of **Daytona** installed on your system
  ([Installation Guide](https://www.daytona.io/docs/installation/installation/))
- An active **Fly.io account** with API access
- The **Fly CLI** installed
  ([Installation Guide](https://fly.io/docs/flyctl/install/))
- Basic familiarity with command-line operations
- Sufficient permissions to create and manage Fly Machines

## Installation and Setup

### 1. Installing the Fly Provider

Start by installing the Fly Provider using the Daytona CLI:

```bash
daytona provider install
```

You'll see a list of available providers. Use the arrow keys to select
`fly-provider`:

### 2. Provider Configuration

The configuration process involves several steps to set up your Fly.io
integration.

#### Step 1: Initialize Target Setup

Run the following command to begin target configuration:

```bash
daytona target set
```

### 3. Creating Your First Workspace

The workspace creation process has been updated with new options and
flexibility. Use the following command structure:

```bash
daytona create [REPOSITORY_URL | PROJECT_CONFIG_NAME] [flags]
```

#### Basic Workspace Creation Options

You can create workspaces in several ways:

1. **From a Git Repository**:

   ```bash
   daytona create https://github.com/daytonaio/content  --name workspacename
   ```

2. **With Custom Image**:

```bash
daytona create https://github.com/daytonaio/content --custom-image ubuntu:latest --custom-image-user ubuntu --name workspacename
```

## Managing Workspaces

### Basic Operations

#### Listing Workspaces

```bash
daytona  list
```

#### Stopping a Workspace

```bash
daytona  stop <workspace-name>
```

#### Starting a Workspace

```bash
daytona  start <workspace-name>
```

#### Deleting a Workspace

```bash
daytona  delete <workspace-name>
```

### Best Practices

1. **Resource Management**

   - Monitor your resource usage regularly
   - Start with smaller instances and scale up as needed
   - Clean up unused workspaces promptly
   - Use appropriate machine sizes for your workload
   - Consider regional pricing differences

2. **Security**

   - Rotate your API keys periodically
   - Use minimal required permissions for your API tokens
   - Keep your Fly CLI and Daytona installations updated
   - Implement proper access controls
   - Regularly audit your workspace configurations

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Choose regions closest to your team
   - Use appropriate machine sizes
   - Monitor resource utilization
   - Implement caching when possible
   - Regular maintenance and updates

## Troubleshooting Guide
