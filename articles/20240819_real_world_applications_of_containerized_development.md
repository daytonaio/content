# Real World Applications of Containerized Development: Case Studies and Lessons Learned

## Introduction

A development container, often called a dev container, serves as a comprehensive development environment within a container. It enables you to run applications, isolate tools, libraries, or runtimes required for a codebase, and supports continuous integration and testing. Dev containers can be utilized both locally and remotely, whether in private or public clouds, and are compatible with [various tools and editors.](https://containers.dev/supporting)

To truly understand the impact of development containers on the developer experience, we need to explore their applications in real-world scenarios. In this extensive article, we will analyze the experiences of various developers documented on the Y Combinator blog, each showcasing how development containers have brought changes to the developer workflow.

### TL;DR
- Benefits offered from using development containers.
- Challenges posed and possible solutions.
- Additional insights into team workflows and onboarding processes.

## Benefits

### Integration with popular IDEs

Many developers appreciate the seamless integration of development containers with various IDEs, the most popular among them being VS Code. This enables a developer to boot up their environments quickly. Another major advantage is the ability to communicate with various [LSP services.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Server_Protocol)

### Environment Isolation

Dependencies, databases, ports and other development variables are well defined in code when using development environments. This prevents the workspace from interacting with and possibly altering with global variables in the host PC. Development environments are also accessible via SSH, enabling remote development.

### Consistency

Development environments enable a consistent workspace setup that is reproducible across various machines. Even while doing native app development, developers still prefer using virtual machines because testing on different OS versions can be quite cumbersome. This saves developer teams time that would be spent onboarding new team members or managing dependency conflicts. Developers have come to assume a Linux environment whether they are working in Windows, Mac or Linux. Furthermore, you can use the same container image for dev environments as well as CI/build environments. This lets developers easily perform testing and validation before pushing changes upstream.

## Challenges

### Complexity

Some developers report that using development containers adds yet another layer of complexity to a project. This can make diagnosing issues a bit trickier. A common solution to this problem is using nix-shell as a lightweight replacement for fully-fledged containers. However, it is noted that Nix has a steeper learning curve. It is possible to configure Nix as well as a dev container for your project, but this is mostly unnecessary and brings even more complexity.

### Integrating higher order tools

Running tools such as a debugger or integrating a GPU can be quite difficult when using a dev container. This may be due to the layer of complexity added by the dev container.

## Conclusion

Incorporating dev environments has various benefits to the developer experience such as environment isolation and consistent workspaces across developer teams. On boarding new developers becomes easier. Moreover, they allow you to scale your dev environment on demand, as opposed to over-committing resources that will not be used. However, this does not come without some drawbacks. A major downside to using dev environments is the increased complexity it brings to a project. All in all, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.
