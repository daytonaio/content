# Streamlining Projects with Daytona’s Container Registry

## Introduction

In modern development workflows, maintaining consistency across various environments is critical to ensure seamless integration and collaboration. [Daytona](https://www.daytona.io)’s container registry tackles this challenge by allowing developers to store and reuse project configurations across multiple workspaces. Powered by Docker, Daytona simplifies setup, reduces onboarding time, and ensures consistency in development environments.

Docker plays a pivotal role here by packaging the development environment into containers, ensuring that all dependencies, tools, and configurations are bundled together. With Daytona’s integration, developers can quickly launch these environments across different systems, avoiding the "works on my machine" problem.

### TL;DR

- **Reusable Configurations**: Daytona’s container registry stores Docker-based project configurations for reuse across workspaces.
- **Easy Setup**: Simplifies setting up and managing Docker containers, reducing onboarding time.
- **Consistency**: Docker ensures that development environments remain consistent across different machines and platforms.

## Adding a Project Configuration

Daytona allows developers to create reusable configurations, including Docker containers, to maintain project consistency. This reduces the need for repetitive setup, allowing you to define build configurations, environment variables, and Docker-based setups.

**Steps to Create a Docker-Backed Project Configuration:**

1. Run the following command to start creating a project configuration:
   ```bash
   daytona project-config add
   ```

2. Enter the repository URL:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/your-username/sample-project
   ```

3. Choose the **Docker-backed build configuration**. Daytona integrates with Docker to provide options such as:
   - **Automatic**: Daytona detects and sets up the container automatically based on project files.
   - **Devcontainer**: Use a predefined [Devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) file to define the Docker environment.
   - **Custom image**: You can also provide a custom Docker image for the project.

4. Define environment variables in the format `KEY=VALUE`. To reference machine variables, use `$VALUE`.

5. Name the configuration, e.g., `MyProjectConfig`. Daytona will store this configuration, allowing you to reuse the Docker-based setup across various workspaces.

### Example Command:

```bash
daytona project-config add --repo https://github.com/sample-repo --build Devcontainer --env "API_KEY=$API_KEY" --name MyProjectConfig
```

Here, Docker is used to ensure that your development environment is packaged and can be replicated easily, whether for a local workspace or in the cloud.

## Managing Docker-Based Project Configurations

Once created, Daytona provides intuitive commands to manage project configurations stored in Docker containers. With Docker's containerization, developers can ensure the same environment is used across different machines or team members.

**Key Command:**
- **View a Project Configuration**:
   ```bash
   daytona project-config info
   ```

   ![View Project Configuration](/assets/20240912_daytona_container_registry_img6.png)

- **List All Docker-Based Configurations**:
   ```bash
   daytona project-config list
   ```

   ![List All Configurations](/assets/20240912_daytona_container_registry_img7.png)

This command allows you to list all Docker-backed configurations, providing details on repository URLs, build configurations (e.g., Devcontainer), and default settings.

### Example Output:

```
Name                Repository                Build        Default
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
MyProjectConfig     https://github.com/user/project    Devcontainer    Yes
```

## Updating and Deleting Project Configurations

Daytona makes it easy to modify existing Docker-based configurations or delete those no longer needed.

- **Update a Project Configuration**:
   ```bash
   daytona project-config update
   ```

   ![Update Project Configuration](/assets/20240912_daytona_container_registry_img8.png)

- **Delete a Project Configuration**:
   ```bash
   daytona project-config delete
   ```

   ![Delete Project Configuration](/assets/20240912_daytona_container_registry_img9.png)

By updating the project configuration, you can modify the Docker container settings, including environment variables and build configurations. This helps keep the containerized development environments up-to-date.

## Conclusion

Daytona’s container registry, integrated with Docker, offers an efficient way to manage and reuse project configurations. Docker’s ability to package environments ensures consistency, while Daytona simplifies the process of deploying and managing these containers across multiple workspaces. Whether working with a devcontainer or a custom Docker image, Daytona’s project configuration feature ensures that development remains smooth and consistent.
