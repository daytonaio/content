# Setting Up and Configuring Containers for GPU-Intensive Tasks

## Step 1: Preparations

**Note:** _[Before setting up the containerized environment for GPU utilization, ensure your system meets the prerequisites]_

- ### Install and Configure Daytona

First, ensure that Daytona is installed and properly configured on your system. Daytona can be installed on Linux, macOS, and Windows systems, with support for both x86_64 and AArch64 architectures. Follow the official installation instructions:

- Linux: Install using the [official installation script](https://www.daytona.io/docs/installation/installation/#official-installation-script).
- macOS: Use Homebrew or the [installation script](https://www.daytona.io/docs/installation/installation/#homebrew-1).
- Windows: Install via PowerShell using the [provided script](https://www.daytona.io/docs/installation/installation/#official-installation-script-2)

- ### Set a Target in Daytona:

Before creating a workspace, you will need to set up a Target, which is essential for managing and deploying your workspaces by following this command.

```bash
daytona target set
```

Example configuration:

```plaintext
Choose a provider
1 item
===
│ docker-provider
│ v0.0.0

Remote Password
>

Remote Port
>

Remote User
Note: non-root user required
>

Sock Path
> /var/run/docker.sock

Workspace Data Dir
The directory on the remote host where the workspace data will be stored
> /tmp/daytona-data
```
Click `Enter` to confirm, and you should see a confirmation message indicating that the `Target was set successfully`.

## Verifying GPU Setup

## Install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit

  Install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit to enable GPU support in Docker:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-container-toolkit
sudo systemctl restart docker
```
This toolkit allows Docker to interface directly with your GPU hardware, a crucial step for GPU-intensive tasks.

### Verify Your GPU Setup

  Confirm that Docker can access your GPU:

```bash
docker run --gpus all nvidia/cuda:11.0-base nvidia-smi
```
This command verifies that your GPU is accessible from within Docker containers.

## Step 2: Setting Up a Workspace in Daytona

For this guide, we will use [nanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT) as our example project. nanoGPT is a lightweight implementation of GPT, making it an best example for demonstrating how to configure and run GPU-intensive tasks in a containerized environment.

### Create a Workspace with the Git Repository:

Daytona workspaces serve as isolated environments containing your projects, containing the codebase, dependencies, packages, and configurations. They ensure consistency across different development, testing, and deployment.

#### Creating a Workspace from a Git Repository:

To directly set up a [workspace from a Git repository]( https://www.daytona.io/docs/usage/workspaces/#create-a-workspace) like nanoGPT, Daytona makes the process straightforward:

1. **Run the Command**:

```bash
daytona create https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT.git
```

This command will clone the nanoGPT repository and set up a new workspace with the project ready for development.

2. **Workspace Setup**:

Daytona manages the initialization and configuration of the workspace, displaying progress information in the terminal. Once completed, the workspace will be ready for use. Example output during workspace creation:

```plaintext
WORKSPACE | ✓ Request submitted
WORKSPACE | ✓ Creating workspace nanoGPT
daytona   | Creating project nanoGPT
daytona   | Pulling image...
daytona   | Pulling from daytonaio/workspace-project
...
daytona   | Project nanoGPT created
daytona   | Starting project nanoGPT
daytona   | Project nanoGPT started
```

#### List Workspaces:

To keep track of all your workspaces:

```bash
daytona list
```

This command lists all created workspaces, including their repository, target, and status.

**Tip**: You can open the created nanoGPT workspace in your preferred [IDE](https://www.daytona.io/docs/reference/cli/#daytona-code) `daytona code` command

## Build and Run the Docker Image

### Create a Dockerfile for nanoGPT

Next, create a Dockerfile tailored to run nanoGPT with GPU support. Here’s an example Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
FROM nvidia/cuda:11.7.1-cudnn8-devel-ubuntu20.04

# Install Python and necessary dependencies

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3-pip git

# Copy nanoGPT code into the container

COPY . /nanoGPT
WORKDIR /nanoGPT

# Install Python dependencies

RUN pip install torch transformers

# Define the entry point for the nanoGPT script

CMD ["python3", "train.py"]
```

### Build the Docker Image

Build the Docker image for nanoGPT:

```bash
docker build -t nanogpt-container .
```

### Run nanoGPT with GPU Support

Run the container, allocating GPU resources for training:

```bash
docker run --gpus all nanogpt-container
```

## Common Challenges and Solutions

As you work with GPU-intensive tasks in containerized environments, you may encounter several challenges. Here’s how to address some common issues:

**Problem:** _[The CUDA version inside the container might not match the GPU driver on the host system]_

**Solution:** _[Ensure that the CUDA version in your container is compatible with your host’s NVIDIA driver. Consult NVIDIA’s [compatibility matrix](https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/cuda-compatibility/index.html) to avoid mismatches]_

**Problem:** _[GPU resources are not being fully utilized, leading to slower performance.]_

**Solution:** _[Profile GPU usage with `nvidia-smi` and optimize your application code. Consider using mixed precision training or inference (fp16) to reduce memory usage and increase throughput]_

**Problem:** _[Installation of dependencies fails due to network issues]_

**Solution:** _[Ensure your network connection is stable and consider using a proxy if necessary]_

**Problem:** _[Python is not recognized as a command]_

**Solution:** _[Make sure Python is installed and accessible in your system's `PATH`]_

**Problem:** _[CUDA is not available after installation.]_

**Solution:** _[Verify that your GPU supports CUDA and that the correct drivers are installed.]_
