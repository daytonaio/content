# **CockroachDB’s Licensing Update: A Wake-Up for OSS**

In August 2024, [Cockroach Labs](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/) made a significant move by altering the licensing of CockroachDB, a popular distributed SQL database. This change has sparked a conversation in the tech community, especially among startup CEOs who rely heavily on [open-source software (OSS)](https://www.daytona.io/dotfiles/building-a-successful-open-source-project) to build and scale their businesses. Traditionally, OSS has been valued for its accessibility and cost-effectiveness, but the shift in CockroachDB’s licensing terms serves as a reminder that these benefits can come with caveats.

Our article examines the implications of CockroachDB's new licensing model, particularly for startups, and discusses why it's crucial to carefully consider the long-term sustainability of the OSS tools you choose.

#### **TL;DR**

* CockroachDB has introduced a more restrictive licensing model targeting large enterprises.  
* The change highlights potential risks for startups relying on OSS without a clear understanding of licensing.  
* Startups should prioritize open-source tools with transparent, stable licensing policies.  
* Contributing to OSS projects can help startups influence future licensing decisions.

## **The Licensing Shift: What It Means**

Cockroach Labs recently announced that its flagship product, CockroachDB, would now fall under a more restrictive license. While startups and smaller companies might still enjoy the benefits of free access, the new license ensures that larger enterprises will need to pay for using the software. This shift represents a significant departure from the more permissive licenses traditionally associated with OSS, such as the Apache 2.0 or MIT licenses.

Cockroach Labs co-founder and CEO Spencer Kimball has addressed this change, noting that:

“It’s just an honor system — most businesses that ought to be paying us aren’t going to lie about something like that. We’ve provided a very good core product that has now crossed a threshold in terms of reliability and capabilities, and in order to build our business we need companies to pay us rather than being free riders. And you can’t blame them — we’re giving these big companies our software for free. But that’s what we’re changing here.”

The new license is **designed to protect Cockroach Labs' revenue** by ensuring that large-scale users contribute financially.

For startups, this licensing change could signal a broader trend. If other OSS projects follow suit, it might become increasingly difficult to distinguish between open-source and proprietary software, potentially leading to unexpected costs and operational challenges.

## **What does it mean for Startups?**

Startups often turn to OSS for its flexibility and cost-effectiveness. However, the recent changes to CockroachDB's licensing model underscore the need for caution. Relying on OSS without a deep understanding of the project's long-term business strategy can leave startups vulnerable to sudden shifts that could impact their operations.

One user voiced concern about the Enterprise edition, commenting that it feels "expensive" and "salesy," with the potential to "end up squeezed by your database vendor." 

This reflects a common fear among startups: the risk of a once-accessible OSS tool becoming a costly burden.

#### What can you do?

* Evaluate the sustainability and business models of OSS projects before committing.   
* Contribute to OSS projects to gain influence and ensure your needs are considered.

The CockroachDB case is a reminder that as these tools evolve, so too can their terms of use. It’s crucial for startup CEOs to engage with the OSS community, understand the potential risks, and plan accordingly.

## **A Well-Considered OSS Model**

As open-source software continues to evolve, startups need to choose projects with stable and transparent business models. Look for tools governed by foundations or communities that focus on long-term sustainability, like the [Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org/). These organizations help ensure that the software remains open and reliable.

It’s also important to pick OSS projects with active communities and clear roadmaps. This shows that the project is well-maintained and less likely to face sudden changes. By engaging with these communities, startups can stay informed and even influence the direction of the software, making it a better fit for their needs.

## **Conclusion**

The licensing changes introduced by Cockroach Labs should prompt startup CEOs to reassess their reliance on open-source tools. While OSS remains a powerful asset, it’s essential to navigate this landscape with a strategic mindset, ensuring that the tools you choose align with your company’s long-term goals. By engaging with the OSS community and contributing where possible, startups can mitigate risks and continue to benefit from the innovation and flexibility that open source offers.

* **Understand Licensing:** Always thoroughly understand the licensing models of the OSS tools you rely on to avoid unexpected costs or restrictions.  
* **Prioritize Sustainability:** Choose OSS projects with stable, transparent business models governed by reliable foundations or communities.  
* **Engage and Contribute:** Actively participate in OSS communities to influence future decisions and ensure that the tools continue to meet your needs.  
* **Plan for the Long Term:** Regularly reassess your OSS tools to ensure they remain aligned with your evolving business goals and strategies.

This approach will help startups go through the challenges posed by evolving OSS models while leveraging the benefits of open-source software for sustained growth.
