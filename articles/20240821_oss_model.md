# Surviving as Open Source These Days: Harder Than You Think

## Overview

Open-source software has been hailed as one of the forces that puts people together in innovation and democratizes access to really cool tools. More recent trends, however, show companies shifting away from full open licenses into more restrictive enterprise-focused models. The questions should be:
- what exactly has driven changes from previously loved open source companies like Cockroach Labs and HashiCorp?
- What does this all mean for the future of open-source software?
- What should tech-startups learn from it?

This article explores the licensing changes in prominent OSS projects, focusing on CockroachDB’s recent shift. We’ll discuss the motivations behind these decisions, identify common patterns, and provide insights into what constitutes a robust and sustainable OSS model.

## Case Study

### Cockroach DB

The very first open-source release of CockroachDB was done under the Apache 2.0 License, after which it gained extreme adoption and huge people/community support. However, CockroachDB faced abuse by cloud-providers, so in 2019, Cockroach Labs changed its licensing to the Business Source License, defining the very notion of open access and finding a way to combine it with control in one commercially available instrument. Recently, they introduced a proprietary model in the CockroachDB software license. Although strategic, this move brought controversy to the community since it deviated from the primary values of the project—being open-sourced.

### Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch - a powerful search and analytics engine - faced the same problems trying to earn revenue and protecting it's trademark, the parent company Elastic even had to file a lawsuit to protect the cloud-providers from abusing it. Cherry on top, Amazon even tweeted about a non-existent collab between the two companies; according to the founder. Finally, they had to take the hard decision of changing the license, and adopting a dual license based on the Apache 2.0 and SSPL, compromising some of the open-source values.

If we look closely into both the companies, what we find in common is that , not much effort is given to deciding the type of license at launch time; this leads to surprises and unexpected shortcomings, and you have no option other than taking a decisive action fast - which is bound to upset a part of the open-source community.

## Main Reasons Behind Ditching Open-source

1. **Protection from Cloud Providers**: This is by-far the most important and sad reason. Most cloud provider giants abuse the open-source nature of these companies and begin making money out of them without giving them anything in return. This leaves companies with just a few options:  either become proprietary or lose some part of open-source. [Read More.](https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/29/the-crusade-against-open-source-abuse/)

2. **Sustainability and Revenue Generation**: Most open-source projects lack a proper sustainable business model - for instance compare MySQL to MongoDB both are databases, and both are almost open-source; except that MongoDB knows how to earn and MySQL doesn't. This is proven by the fact that MongoDB has an annual revenue of **[$154 M](https://growjo.com/company/MongoDB)** compared to MySQL's **[$37 M](https://growjo.com/company/Oracle_MySQL)**. This leads to the company either dying, getting bought by a tech giant, or choosing an enterprise license.

3. **Maintaining Competitive Advantage**: Open-source licenses, while fostering innovation, can sometimes erode a company’s competitive advantage. While your competitor is claiming to have built the service on it's own; you know that it's just your code running behind the scenes with some modifications - something cloud providers are famous for. By restricting certain commercial uses, companies can retain control over how their software is used, ensuring that they remain competitive in the market.

4. **Community and Ecosystem Management**: A more restrictive license can be a means of managing the ecosystem that has piled up around the software. Enterprises set a clear boundary on how their software should be used, hence setting the development and use of products along with the company's long-term objectives.

## A good OSS Model

By now you must have realized how important is it have a good, well-planned Open-source software model. Now let's discuss how you can lead your OSS into becoming great:

- **Have the perfect license**: The licensing model should support the company’s overall business strategy, whether that’s driving adoption, generating revenue, or maintaining control over the software’s evolution.

- **Adapt to Market Dynamics and Trends**: The software industry is constantly evolving, and so should your licensing model. Be prepared to adapt your strategy as new challenges and opportunities arise. Be observed in **hackathons** and **dev programs**, **[publish content](https://opensource.com/article/21/10/content-marketing-open-source-community)** on latest trends if possible in order to stay in people's sight. Remember, if you are a startup, you need to attract sponsors and funding, which comes by having a good online presence.

- **Ensure Long-term Sustainability**: Ultimately, the goal of any licensing strategy should be to ensure the long-term sustainability of the project. This includes not only financial viability but also continued innovation and relevance in the market. You don't want to discover that companies are abusing your product and printing loads of money, while you are  - as a startup - struggling to generate a revenue.

- **Promote Community Engagement**: Even with more restrictive licenses, it’s crucial to maintain a vibrant and engaged community. Open-source projects thrive on community contributions, which can drive innovation and improve the software. Start with a creative and skilled team of maintainers and contributors who know what is quality code.

- **Offer Clarity and Fairness**: The terms of the license should be clear, fair, and easy to understand. Ambiguity can lead to mistrust or misuse, which can harm the project in the long run. It would be a nightmare to find people taking advantages of some loopholes no one at your team even noticed.

## Final Thoughts

Wrapping things up, I'd like to highlight that while it is easy to believe that propriety software is the best; let's not forget that open-source has the power of public innovation: where a whole community drives a project to its peak. A well considered OSS model with a responsible community makes the products which power the world: whether it be Linux, Firefox, Blender or Python.

Hope this helps you with your next startup, see you next time with another great topic!
