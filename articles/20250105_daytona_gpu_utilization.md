# GPU Utilization in Daytona for LLM Fine Tuning and Inference

## Introduction

GPU utilization refers to the usage of a percentage of a [GPU's](/definitions/20250105_definition_gpu.md) processing power for
tasks like graphics rendering, simulations, or data computations. [High utilization](/definitions/20250105_definition_high_gpu_utilization.md) indicates
efficient resource use, while [low utilization](/definitions/20250105_definition_low_gpu_utilization.md) suggests underuse or idle resources.
It is a key metric for optimizing performance and ensuring hardware efficiency.

In [large language model](/definitions/20250105_definition_llm.md) (LLM) [fine-tuning](/definitions/20250105_definition_llm_fine_tuning.md) and [inference](/definitions/20250105_definition_llm_inference.md), GPU utilization is critical. During fine-tuning,
GPUs handle intensive computations to update model weights, requiring high utilization for efficiency.
In inference, GPUs process model outputs in real-time, where balanced utilization ensures fast and
reliable predictions.

This guide you will walk you through setting up a Daytona environment for [LLM Fine-Tuning](/definitions/20250105_definition_llm_fine_tuning.md) and [LLM Inference](/definitions/20250105_definition_llm_inference.md). This article assumes you have a [CUDA-enabled GPU](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus)
,and a Linux based system(Windows users have to use WSL).You will use [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) containers, [Daytona](https://www.daytona.io/docs/installation/installation/) and an IDE like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

## Overview of LLMs (Large Language Models)

[Large Language Models](/definitions/20250105_definition_llm.md) (LLMs) are advanced AI systems designed to understand, generate,
and manipulate human language.Built using deep learning architectures, particularly transformer
models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), LLMs are trained on vast datasets
comprising text from books,websites, and other sources.Their primary strength lies in generating
contextually relevant and coherent text based on user prompts.

## Overview of LLM Fine-Tuning

[Fine-tuning](/definitions/20250105_definition_llm_fine_tuning.md) is the process of adapting a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) to perform specific
tasks or excel in particular domains. While LLMs are initially trained on vast datasets to develop
a general understanding of language, fine-tuning leverages domain-specific data to refine the modelâ€™s
performance for specific applications. Fine-tuning is necessary because pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs),
while good at general language understanding, often lack the precision required for numerous fields.
It enables models to become better by aligning them with the vocabulary, structure, and nuances of a particular
task or domain, thereby improving the quality and accuracy of outputs. Fine-tuning also allows for cost efficiency,
as it leverages pre-trained models instead of training from scratch, saving significant computational resources.
Additionally, it allows organizations to customize models to their specific application requirements, making them
more effective and contextually relevant.

## Overview of LLM Inference

[LLM Inference](/definitions/20250105_definition_llm_inference.md) refers to the phase where a trained LLM is used to generate predictions or responses based on queries.
During inference, the model processes the input, retrieves relevant learned patterns, and outputs the most contextually
appropriate text.. The process begins with [tokenizing](/definitions/20250105_definition_tokenization.md) the input into smaller units, such as words or subwords, which are
numerically encoded for model processing. The encoded tokens are passed through the LLM, where neural networks identify
contextual relationships between tokens. Based on these computations, the model predicts the most likely next token(s)
iteratively, generating the output text one token at a time. This continues until a stopping criterion, such as a specific
token or maximum length, is met. Finally, the generated tokens are decoded back into text and formattedas the final response.

## Overview of Daytona

Daytona is a platform that enables users to create
and share fully configured [development environments](/definitions/20240819_definition_development%20environment.md), allowing for faster
onboarding, collaboration, and consistent setups across teams.Daytona enables
you to manage and deploy [Workspaces](/definitions/20240819_definition_daytona%20workspace.md), which are reproducible development
environments built on standard OCI containers, and it includes native support
for the Dev Container standard. The architecture of Daytona is designed to
potentially support other configuration standards in the future, such as
[Dockerfiles](/definitions/20240819_definition_docker.md),[Docker Compose](/definitions/20240819_definition_docker%20compose.md), Nix, and Devfile.

For more information about Daytona check out its [docs](https://daytona.io/docs)

You can find the Github repository where my devcontainer configuration files
which I used for this guide
[here](https://github.com/stdthoth/daytona-gpu-utilization).

## Prerequsites and System Architecture

Before starting the process for GPU-based LLM fine-tuning and
inference with Daytona, ensure your system meets the following
requirements:

**Hardware**:
- **CPU**: x86_64 (amd64) or ARM architecture(Nvidia Jetson devices)
- **GPU**: CUDA-compatible NVIDIA GPU (e.g. RTX 20xx,30xx, Quadro series, Axx,Hxx)
- **Memory**: Minimum of 4GB RAM recommended, 16GB or more for
better performance

**Software**:
- **Operating System**: Linux debian based distro like Ubuntu and
Windows via WSL2 Ubuntu distribution.
- **Docker**: Must be instsalled and cofigured for running
containers.
- **Nvidia Drivers**: Ensure the correct GPU drivers for your
GPU is installed. you can verify this by running `nvidia-smi`

**Environment**:
- **CUDA**: Install the correct version of the CUDA toolkit
matching your GPU drivers. Ensure compatibility between Docker
images and the driver version, Ideally you should use a docker image lower than the CUDA driver version i.e if your CUDA driver
version is `12.4` you should use a docker image with `12.3.x` tag.
- **WSL**: For windows users, ensure that WSL2 is properly
configured to allow GPU access within Linux environments.

## Installation and verification of all essential software

For this setup I am currently using a hardware setup(Physical GPU device) but if you dont have that you can follow along by  getting a gpu enable VM from cloud providers.

If you're using a GPU enabled Linux VM, install important
programs like git and build essential by running

```bash
  sudo apt-get install -y git build-essential
```

Before setting up the [dev container](/definitions/20240819_definition_development%20container.md) configuration you should verify if your WSL,Docker,CUDA compatiblity,if the drivers are installed on the host machine and the Nvidia
Container Toolkit installation status.
  
  You can verify if your Nvidia GPU is CUDA compatible by checking
  if your GPU model is on the list located [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus)

  For Windows Users, to verify if WSL is installed, Open up
  Powershell and run :
  
  ```bash
  wsl --status
  ````
  If WSL is installed it should show the default WSL version, kernel version and the default distribution. If WSL is not installed you can install it by running :

  ```bash
  wsl --install
  ```
  To verify if Docker is installed and running:

  Open up a terminal (Powershell, Linux shell e.t.c) and run
  this command :
  
  ```bash
  docker --version
  ```
  If Docker is installed it should output something like:

  ```bash
  Docker version 24.0.5, build a8a2b3b
  ```
  If Docker is not installed you can install it from [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/) on
  Windows and on Ubuntu you can install it by running the following:

  Set up Docker's apt repository
  
  ```bash
  # Add Docker's official GPG key:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Add the repository to Apt sources:
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "${UBUNTU_CODENAME:-$VERSION_CODENAME}") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
  ```
  Install Docker's packages

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
  ```
  To verify [GPU driver](/definitions/20250105_definition_gpu_driver.md) status and install Nvidia Container Toolkit

  To verify your driver status open your terminal and run this command

  ```bash
  nvidia-smi
  ```
  You should get an output resembling the below image

  ![image of nvidia-smi output](assets/20250105_daytona_gpu_utilization_img_1.PNG)

  If you do not have drivers installed get them from [here](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/)
  depending on your OS and GPU hardware,
  
  If drivers are installled open your shell(WSL foe windows users) and check if the Nvidia Container Toolkit is installed with:

  ```bash
    dpkg -l | grep nvidia-container-toolkit
  ```
  If installed it will show the package version, if it isn't installed run this command to add the production repository.

  ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/gpgkey | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg \
  && curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/stable/deb/nvidia-container-toolkit.list | \
    sed 's#deb https://#deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg] https://#g' | \
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-container-toolkit.list
  ```
  Update the package list from the repository
  ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
  ```
  Install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit packages
  ```bash
    sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-container-toolkit
  ```
  Configure the runtime with this command
  
  ```bash
    sudo nvidia-ctk runtime configure
    sudo systemctl restart docker
  ```
  Once everything is setup you can run a CUDA enabled container with GPU access with
  this command

  ```bash
    docker run --gpus all nvidia/cuda:12.0.1-base nvidia-smi
  ```
  Ensure that the Windows/Linux drivers are compatible with the CUDA version in your Docker image,
  i.e a driver version of 12.5 should be used with a CUDA docker image of version 12.5 or less
  since there is backward compatibilty between them.

## Special Considerations for Windows Users

- Window users should install drivers from Nvidia on their host machine and should not install them on the WSL distribution  
- For Windows users, If you have Nvidia GPU drivers already installed on their
  system, CUDA becomes available within WSL2. The CUDA driver installed on windows will be stubbed
  inside the WSL2, therefore users must not install any Nvidia GPU Linux driver within WSL2 to
  avoid conflicts.
- Windows users should install Docker Desktop and run it by simply opening the desktop app on their host machine instead of installing the Docker engine in WSL to avoid
issues using the Docker Daemon.

## Setup Dev Container Configuration for GPU Utilization
  
  Create a Dev Container configuration
  
  Here, you're going to create a dev container consisting of a `devcontainer.json` file, a
  `Dockerfile` and Python Scripts.  
  
  Create a new directory and move inside of it

  ```bash
  mkdir daytona-gpu-utilization && cd daytona-gpu-utilization
  ```
  Create a .devcontainer directory.This is where your devcontainer.json and dockerfiles will live

  ```bash
  mkdir .devcontainer && cd .devcontainer
  ```
  Inside the .devcontainer folder you are going to create a `devcontainer.json` file with the following code.
  This is the configuration file for the dev environment specifying settings and
  dependencies.

  ```json
    {
    "name": "Daytona GPU Utilization",
    "build": {
        "context": "..",
        "dockerfile": "Dockerfile"
    },
    "customizations": {
       "vscode": {
            "extensions": [
                "ms-python.python",
                "ms-vscode.cpptools",
                "ms-python.vscode-pylance"
            ]
        }
    },
    "runArgs": [
    "--gpus", "all"  // Ensures GPU access
  ],
    "forwardPorts": []
    
}
  ```
Let's breakdown the `devcontainer.json` file

- `name`: Specifies the name of the development environment.
- `build`: Configures the `Dockerfile` and build related options
- `customizations`:Allows customization of the development environment,
  specifically for VS Code.
- `vscode`: Automatically installs Python extension for VS Code, enabling
  some IDE features (e.g. linting, definition, debugging e.t.c)
- `runArgs`: This is the argument required to start the container. The variable `"[--gpus, "all"]`
  ensure the container starts with GPU access.

You will create a Dockerfile in the same directory

  ```dockerfile
  FROM nvidia/cuda:12.3.2-cudnn9-runtime-ubuntu22.04
  RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
      python3-pip
  WORKDIR /workspace

  RUN pip install --upgrade pip \
      && pip install torch torchvision torchaudio transformers datasets accelerate torchmetrics

  COPY *.py /workspace/
  COPY data.txt /workspace/

  CMD [ "bash" ]
  ```
  Let's breakdown the `Dockerfile`

- `FROM nvidia/cuda:12.3.2-cudnn9-runtime-ubuntu22.04`: This is the image provided by Nvidia which ensures GPU accelerated computations and provides optimized libraries for deep learning workloads. You may choose to use other image tags like `base`or `devel`
depending on your specific need or complexity of operation
- `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \python3-pip`: Installs Python3 and `pip` Python's package
  manager. The flag `-y` automatically confirms prompts during installation.
- `WORKDIR /workspace`: Sets the default working directory inside the container to `/workspace`, any subsequent
  operations like `COPY` and `RUN` will be relative to this directory.
- `RUN pip install --upgrade pip \ pip install torch torchvision torchaudio transformers datasets accelerate torchmetrics`:
  Ensures the latest version of `pip` is being used and installs necessary libraries like `torch` is the core PyTorch library
  which is necessary for deep learning operations,`torchvision`which is an image processing utility for PyTorch,`torchaudio`
  is an audio processing utility for PyTorch,`transformers` is Huggingface library for NLP models like GPT,`datasets` is used
  to manage datasets, `accelerate` is used to simplify distributed training and `torchmetrics` is used to provide metrics for
  evaluating PyTorch models.
- `COPY *.py /workspace/`: Copies all Python files from the host directory into the container.
- `COPY data.txt /workspace/`: Copies the `train.txt` file to your workspace.
- `CMD [ "bash" ]`: This opens up a shell prompt inside the container when you can execute your scripts manually.

Navigate to the parent directory, you will create several files which will be used for the LLM fine-tuning and
inference workflow

Create a `gpu_check.py` script for the purpose of checking the GPU availability and GPU device name

```python
import torch

if torch.cuda.is_available():
    print("GPU is available.")
    print("Device name:", torch.cuda.get_device_name(0))

else:
    print("GPU is not available.")
```

Create a `data.txt` file which will provide the dataset for fine-tuning the LLM

```text
    Genghis Khan was born TemÃ¼jin, was the founder of the Mongol Empire, the largest contiguous empire in history. 
    Rising from humble beginnings, he united the Mongol tribes and became their leader in 1206. His military genius, 
    including strategic innovation and organized armies, led to vast conquests across Asia and parts of Europe. 
    Genghis Khan established a strong empire with efficient governance, promoting trade, religious tolerance, 
    and cultural exchange. Despite his brutal conquests, his legacy includes unifying the Mongols and laying the 
    foundation for global trade, with his descendants further expanding the empire.
```
Create a `finetune_workflow.py` script that will be used to fine tune the LLM

```python
from transformers import GPT2Tokenizer, GPT2LMHeadModel, Trainer, TrainingArguments
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load dataset
dataset = load_dataset("text", data_files={"train": "data.txt"})

# Load tokenizer and model
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained("gpt2")

# Add or set a pad token
if tokenizer.pad_token is None:
    tokenizer.pad_token = tokenizer.eos_token  # Use the EOS token as padding token

# Tokenize data
def tokenize_function(examples):
    tokens = tokenizer(examples["text"], truncation=True, padding="max_length", max_length=50)
    tokens["labels"] = tokens["input_ids"].copy()  # Add labels for computing the loss
    return tokens

tokenized_dataset = dataset.map(tokenize_function, batched=True)

# Handle small datasets: Skip split if the dataset is too small
if len(tokenized_dataset["train"]) > 1:
    tokenized_dataset = tokenized_dataset["train"].train_test_split(test_size=0.5)
else:
    # Use the same dataset for both train and test
    tokenized_dataset = {"train": tokenized_dataset["train"], "test": tokenized_dataset["train"]}

# Training arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./results",
    overwrite_output_dir=True,
    num_train_epochs=300,
    per_device_train_batch_size=2,
    save_steps=10,
    save_total_limit=2,
    logging_dir="./logs",
    logging_steps=10,
)

# Trainer
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=tokenized_dataset["train"],
    eval_dataset=tokenized_dataset["test"],
)

# Fine-tune the model
trainer.train()

# Save the fine-tuned model
model.save_pretrained("./fine_tuned_gpt2")
tokenizer.save_pretrained("./fine_tuned_gpt2")
```
Create a `inference_workflow.py` script which whill be used to run LLM inference and prompt the fine tuned
GPT model

```python
from transformers import GPT2Tokenizer, GPT2LMHeadModel

# Load fine-tuned model
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained("./fine_tuned_gpt2")
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained("./fine_tuned_gpt2")

# Generate text
input_text = "Who is Gengis Khan"
input_ids = tokenizer.encode(input_text, return_tensors="pt")

output = model.generate(input_ids, max_length=300, num_return_sequences=1)
print(tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True))

```

Initialize,commmit and create a GitHub repository

  ```bash
  git init
  git add .
  git commit -m "inital commit"
  ```

  After commiting your code you will push it to a remote repository of your
  choice.

  ```bash
  git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/YOUR-DIRECTORY-NAME.git
  git branch -M main
  git push -u origin main
  ```

## Setup workspace environment in Daytona

If you are using a Linux VM you will need to SSH into the server
before attempting to build the workspace with Daytona. You can learn how to SSH into a Linux server [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRlTJW8HYs4)
You should ensure `daytona` is
installed on you machine before proceeding.

Execute the command provided below to start the `daytona` server daemon. when
prompted to start the server in the current terminal session click `yes`

```bash
  daytona server
  ```
Your output should look like the image below

  ![image of running daytona server](assets/20250105_daytona_gpu_utilization_img_2.png)

Create a new workspace by running the below command

```bash
  daytona create
  ```
Your output should look like the image below

  ![image of running daytona server](assets/20250105_daytona_gpu_utilization_img_3.png)

Select and add the repository where your files are located and click enter, the workspace will start building,
your output should look like the images below

## Running LLM fine-tuning on GPT 2

Before carrying out any operation you would want to verify if your GPU is available and being accessed, In
order to achieve this navigate to your terminal and running this command

```bash
  python3 gpu_check.py
```
Your output should look like the image below

  ![image of gpu check output](assets/20250105_daytona_gpu_utilization_img_8.png)

To perform LLM fine-tuning workflow run this command

```bash
  python3 finetune_workflow.py
```
Your output should look like the image below

  ![image of running fine tune workflow](assets/20250105_daytona_gpu_utilization_img_9.png)

- `loss`: The loss measures how far off the model's prediction are from true values. It quantifies the error
during training. The training process aims to reduce this value.
- `grad_norm`: The norm (magnitude) of the gradient vector, which indicates the size of
the change in model parameters during optimization. This helps monitor and control the optimization process.
If the gradient norm is too large, it can lead to unstable updates.
- `learning_rate`: A hyperparameter that controls the size of the steps the optimization algorithm takes during
training. It balances the speed and stability of training. If the learning rate is too high it may diverge and if
it is too slow training may get stuck.

## Running LLM Inference on Fine-tune GPT 2 model

To perform LLM fine-tuning workflow in the workspace, navigate to your terminal and run this command

```bash
  python3 inference_workflow.py

```
Your output should look like the image below

  ![image of running fine tune workflow](assets/20250105_daytona_gpu_utilization_img_10.png)

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

**GPU cannot be accessed or GPU is unavailable**: Check the status of your GPU drivers installed on your
host machine. Verify if Nvidia Container toolkit is installation status.

**Slow Performance during fine-tuning or inference**: Verify the script is using the GPU by running `nvidia-smi`.
Optimize script by quantitizing model or inceasing batch size.

**Build Target** : The build target may need to be set to docker manually. You
can set it with `daytona target set`

## Conclusion

In conclusion, by following this guide, you've successfully set up a Daytona GPU Powered enviroment.
With a reproducible and isolated environment at your disposal, you can now experiment, test, and
develop and run different LLM workflows without affecting any of your other projects.
This setup not only streamlines your workflow but also allows you to explore new ideas and technologies.
