## Prerequisites and Initial Setup

Before proceeding with the setup, ensure you have Docker installed on your system. You can verify the installation by running:

```bash
docker --version
```

For detailed installation instructions, follow the [Daytona Installation Guide](https://daytona.io/docs) for your operating system.

## Setting Up the Development Environment

Let's walk through the process of setting up your development environment for Phi-3 and .NET development using `devcontainer.json`.

### 1. Project Initialization

First, create a new directory for your project:

```bash
# Create project directory, e.g,
mkdir phi-3_devcontainer
cd phi-3_devcontainer
```

### 2. Development Container Setup

The development container configuration involves creating necessary configuration files and setting up the environment.

1. **Create Container Configuration Directory:** In your project root, create a `.devcontainer` directory if it doesnâ€™t already exist.

   ```bash
   mkdir .devcontainer
   cd .devcontainer
   ```

2. **Create the required configuration directories and files:**

   ```bash
   touch devcontainer.json
   touch Dockerfile
   ```

3. **Configure your development container by adding the following content to the `devcontainer.json`:**

   ```json
   {
     "name": "Daytona .NET Environment",
     "dockerFile": "Dockerfile",
     "customizations": {
       "vscode": {
         "extensions": [
           "ms-dotnettools.csharp",
           "ms-vscode.vscode-node-azure-pack"
         ],
         "settings": {
           "terminal.integrated.shell.linux": "/bin/bash"
         }
       }
     },
     "postCreateCommand": "dotnet restore"
   }
   ```

4. **Set up the `Dockerfile` with the necessary .NET configuration:** Define the base image and install necessary dependencies:

   ```dockerfile
   FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:7.0
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY . .
   RUN dotnet restore
   ```

With the .NET environment in place, you need to configure it for Phi-3.5 Labs.

1. **Install Dependencies**: Add any required dependencies to your `Dockerfile` or install them manually in the Daytona container.

   ```dockerfile
   RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
       libfoo-dev \
       libbar-dev
   ```

2. **Download Phi-3.5 Models**: Use a script to download and set up Phi-3.5 models. Create a `setup.sh` script:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   mkdir -p /models/phi-3
   wget -O /models/phi-3/phi-3.5-model.bin https://example.com/phi-3.5-model.bin
   ```

   Add this script to your `postCreateCommand` in `devcontainer.json`:

   ```json
   "postCreateCommand": "./setup.sh"
   ```

3. **Configure your project file by creating a `Phi3Sample.csproj` file and adding the following script:**

   ```xml
   <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
   <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>net7.0</TargetFramework>
   </PropertyGroup>
   </Project>
   ```

4. **To run and test Phi-3.5 Labs samples, navigate to your project directory on your terminal and run the sample project:**:

   ```bash
   dotnet run --project Phi3Sample.csproj
   ```

Ensure that the samples run correctly and test various functionalities. Here's a basic sample to verify your setup:

```csharp
// Phi3Sample.cs
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Running Phi-3.5 Labs Sample");
    }
}
```

### 3. Launch Daytona Environment

After setting up your configuration files and pushing to a new repository, you can now launch your Daytona environment by following these steps:

1. **Start the Daytona server:**

   ```bash
   daytona serve
   ```

2. **Initialize your project by creating a new Daytona workspace:**

   ```bash
   daytona create your-repo-url
   ```

- Use branching for experiments

## Troubleshooting

Here are common issues while setting up your Daytona project and possible solutions:

#### 1. Connectivity Issues

If your VPN is configured to handle all IP traffic or if your Firewall is configured to block certain IP addresses, they may prevent Daytona from successfully connecting to our reverse proxy service.

To work around this issue, you may need to add the following IP address exceptions to your VPN or Firewall:

- <span style="color:green">35.198.165.62</span> - Europe-based reverse proxy
- <span style="color:green">34.133.75.4</span> - US-based reverse proxy

#### 2. Model Loading Problems

- Check memory allocation
- Verify model path
- Update dependencies
