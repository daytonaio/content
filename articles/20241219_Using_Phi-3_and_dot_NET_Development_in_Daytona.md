## Prerequisites and Initial Setup

### 1. Core Dependencies

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following installed:

```bash
# Verify Docker installation
docker --version

# Verify Git installation
git --version
```

### 2. Daytona Installation and Configuration
 Follow the [Daytona Installation Guide](https://daytona.io/docs) for your operating system.

## Setting Up the Development Environment

### 1. Project Initialization

```bash
# Create project directory
mkdir phi3-daytona-project
cd phi3-daytona-project

# Initialize git repository
git init

# Create .gitignore
echo "bin/
obj/
.vs/
.vscode/" > .gitignore
```

### 2. Development Container Setup

1. **Create Container Configuration Directory**

   ```bash
   mkdir .devcontainer
   cd .devcontainer
   ```

2. **Create Configuration Files**

   ```bash
   touch devcontainer.json
   touch Dockerfile
   ```

3. **Configure devcontainer.json**

   ```json
   {
     "name": "Daytona .NET Environment",
     "dockerFile": "Dockerfile",
     "customizations": {
       "vscode": {
         "extensions": [
           "ms-dotnettools.csharp",
           "ms-vscode.vscode-node-azure-pack"
         ],
         "settings": {
           "terminal.integrated.shell.linux": "/bin/bash"
         }
       }
     },
     "postCreateCommand": "dotnet restore"
   }
   ```

4. **Create Dockerfile**

   ```dockerfile
   FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:7.0
   WORKDIR /app
   RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    python3 \
    python3-pip \
    git
   COPY . .
   RUN dotnet restore
   ```

### 3. Launch Daytona Environment

```bash
# Initialize Daytona project, 
daytona create your-repo-url
# e.g daytona create https://github.com/oreoluwa212/phi-3_devcontainer

# Start the development environment
daytona serve
```
Daytona will now be ready to manage the project.

## Configuring Phi-3.5 Labs

### 1. Create .NET Project

```bash
# Create new .NET solution
dotnet new sln -n Phi3Demo

# Create console project
dotnet new console -n Phi3Demo.Console
dotnet sln add Phi3Demo.Console/Phi3Demo.Console.csproj
```

### 2. Set Up Phi-3.5 Integration

Create a basic C# program to test Phi-3.5:

```csharp
using Microsoft.SemanticKernel;
using Microsoft.SemanticKernel.Connectors.AI.Phi;

class Program
{
    static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        var kernelBuilder = new KernelBuilder();

        // Configure Phi-3.5
        kernelBuilder.WithPhi35TextGeneration(new PhiConfig
        {
            ModelPath = "microsoft/phi-3.5"
        });

        var kernel = kernelBuilder.Build();

        // Test prompt
        var result = await kernel.RunAsync("Explain quantum computing in simple terms.");
        Console.WriteLine(result);
    }
}
```

## Running and Testing

### 1. Build and Run

```bash
cd Phi3Demo.Console
dotnet run
```

### 2. Testing Features

```bash
# Run tests
dotnet test

# Execute sample prompts
dotnet run -- --prompt "Explain artificial intelligence"
```
