# Navigating Open Source Licensing: Lessons from CockroachDB's Recent Changes

## Introduction

In the fast-paced world of technology startups, the choice of software infrastructure can be as critical as the product itself. Open-source solutions like CockroachDB, a distributed SQL database designed for cloud environments, have become the backbone of scalable and reliable systems for many companies. However, recent changes in Cockroach Labs' licensing model have sparked discussions about the sustainability and future of open-source software (OSS).

Understanding these changes is crucial for startup CEOs. They not only affect your immediate operations but also raise broader questions about the viability and risks of depending on OSS. This article explores CockroachDB's licensing shift, why it matters to your business, and how you can navigate similar challenges in the future.

### TL;DR

- **Cockroach Labs Licensing Update**: CockroachDB's new licensing model now requires companies with over $10 million in annual revenue to pay for its usage.
- **Impact on Startups**: Smaller companies and individual developers can still use CockroachDB's enterprise features for free, but there are implications for scalability and cost as businesses grow.
- **Key Takeaways**: Startup CEOs must stay informed about licensing terms, understand the business models behind OSS, and plan for potential changes in their tech stack.

## The Shift in CockroachDB's Licensing

Cockroach Labs, the company behind CockroachDB, has recently made a significant change to its licensing model. Starting with version 24.3, the company will consolidate its self-hosted product under a single enterprise license, a move designed to ensure that larger companies contribute financially for using their software.

### Key Changes:

- **New Licensing Model**: The new CockroachDB Enterprise License (CEL) requires any company with more than $10 million in annual revenue to pay based on the number of CPUs or CPU cores used.
- **Support for Startups**: Smaller companies, individual developers, students, and academic researchers can continue to use the enterprise features for free, maintaining the accessibility that has made CockroachDB popular among startups.
- **Retirement of Core Offering**: The free Core offering will be retired, replaced by a streamlined 30-day trial experience for the enterprise tier, giving all users access to the full capabilities of CockroachDB.

This licensing change is aimed at preventing larger businesses from using the software for free while still supporting smaller startups. Cockroach Labs' goal is to sustain its business model while continuing to innovate and support the open-source community.

## Why This Matters to Startup CEOs

For startup CEOs, the implications of CockroachDB’s licensing changes extend far beyond the immediate impact on their tech stack. Open-source software is often seen as a cost-effective solution for startups, providing powerful tools without the hefty price tags of commercial alternatives. However, the recent shift in CockroachDB’s licensing highlights the potential risks associated with relying on OSS.

### Key Considerations:

- **Scalability and Costs**: As your startup scales, what begins as a free tool can become a significant expense if your business grows and falls under the new licensing terms.
- **Licensing Awareness**: The CockroachDB example underscores the importance of understanding the motivations behind open-source projects and the potential for licensing changes.
- **Contribution to OSS**: Startups may need to consider contributing financially to the OSS projects they depend on, not just to support those projects but to ensure their continued availability.

## Learning from CockroachDB

The situation with CockroachDB offers several lessons for startups navigating the complex world of open-source software:

1. **Conduct Thorough Due Diligence**: Regularly review the licensing terms of the open-source tools you use, and stay updated on any potential changes.
2. **Understand the Business Behind the Software**: Know who controls the project and their long-term goals, which can provide insights into potential future changes.
3. **Plan for Licensing Changes**: Have a contingency plan in place for critical software components, including budgeting for license fees as your startup grows.
4. **Consider Contributing Back**: If your startup heavily relies on a particular open-source project, consider contributing back to support its sustainability.
5. **Be Prepared to Pivot**: Ensure your team is flexible and capable of adapting to new tools or changes in licensing models without significant disruption.

### Code Example

```python
# Example of due diligence in checking licensing
# This is a conceptual example and not specific to any language

def check_oss_license(software):
    # Check the current license of the software
    license_info = get_license_info(software)
    print(f"Current License for {software}: {license_info}")

check_oss_license("CockroachDB")
```

## Conclusion

The recent changes in CockroachDB’s licensing model serve as a reminder of the evolving nature of open-source software. As a startup CEO, it's crucial to recognize the importance of understanding and planning for these changes. Open-source software can offer tremendous value, but it also comes with its own set of risks and responsibilities.

By staying informed, conducting thorough due diligence, and being proactive in managing your software stack, you can ensure that your startup remains agile and prepared for whatever changes come your way. In doing so, you'll not only protect your business but also contribute to the broader open-source community, ensuring that these valuable tools continue to thrive.
