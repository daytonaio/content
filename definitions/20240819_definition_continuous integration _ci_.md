# Continuous Integration (CI)

## Definition

Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice in which developers frequently merge their code changes into a shared repository. This shared repository serves as a central location where all developers can access and collaborate on the codebase.

The primary goal of CI is to ensure that new code changes are integrated smoothly into the existing codebase, allowing for rapid feedback and early issue detection.

To achieve this, automated builds and tests are performed after each code merge, providing immediate feedback to the developers. These automated processes can catch issues early, such as code conflicts or integration problems, helping to maintain code quality and preventing future problems.

CI also encourages a more collaborative and iterative approach to development, allowing developers to work more efficiently and reducing the risks associated with large-scale merges or delayed integration. By providing rapid feedback and catching issues early, CI helps to improve the overall stability and quality of the codebase.
