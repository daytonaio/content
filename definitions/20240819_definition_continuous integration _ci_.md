# Continuous Integration (CI)

## Definition

Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice in which developers
frequently merge their code changes into a shared repository. This shared
repository serves as a central location where all developers can access and
collaborate on the codebase.

The primary goal of CI is to ensure that new code changes are integrated
smoothly into the existing codebase, allowing for rapid feedback and early issue
detection.

To achieve this, automated builds and tests are performed after each code merge,
providing immediate feedback to the developers. These automated processes can
catch issues early, such as code conflicts or integration problems, helping to
maintain code quality and preventing future problems.

CI also encourages a more collaborative and iterative approach to development,
allowing developers to work more efficiently and reducing the risks associated
with large-scale merges or delayed integration. By providing rapid feedback and
catching issues early, CI helps to improve the overall stability and quality of
the codebase.
