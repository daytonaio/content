# Disposable Environments

## Definition

A disposable environment refers to a standalone, self-contained environment that
can be easily created, utilized for its intended purpose, and subsequently
permanently destroyed as desired. This approach is often employed in software
development and testing, where it allows developers and quality assurance teams
to efficiently reproduce and isolate specific scenarios without impacting
existing systems. By providing a controlled and segregated space, disposable
environments help minimize dependencies and conflicts that may arise between
different software components. As a result, developers can confidently
experiment, modify, and test their code without causing disruptions or permanent
changes to the production environment. Furthermore, disposable environments
foster agility and facilitate rapid iteration by streamlining the process of
setting up and tearing down testing environments.
