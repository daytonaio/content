# CUDA

## Definition

CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is a parallel computing platform
and programming model developed by NVIDIA that allows developers to use the
power of NVIDIA GPUs for general-purpose computing. It provides extensions to
languages like C, C++, and Python, enabling programmers to write code that runs
directly on the GPU, leveraging its massive parallelism to accelerate computations.

## Context and Usage

CUDA is widely used in fields that demand computational efficiency and scalability.
Machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch integrate CUDA to accelerate
model training and inference on GPUs. In scientific research, CUDA enables simulations
in fields such as physics, chemistry, and biology by significantly speeding up calculations
Additionally, industries like video production, finance, and gaming leverage CUDA for tasks like real-time rendering, risk analysis, and visual effects. Its compatibility with NVIDIA GPUs and robust ecosystem of libraries makes CUDA a critical tool for high-performance computing applications.
