# Cloud Modeling (C-Model)

## Definition

C-Model refers to the process of utilizing cloud-based environments to configure, deploy, and manage AI models, such as Phi-3, alongside development tools like .NET. It involves the integration of cloud platforms, containerization (e.g., using devcontainers), and machine learning models to streamline development, testing, and deployment workflows.

## Context and Usage

C-Model is used in the context of AI and machine learning development when teams leverage cloud platforms like Daytona to run and experiment with AI models in a scalable and collaborative manner. The approach simplifies model management and fosters efficient workflows in cloud-based environments, improving collaboration, automation, and scalability.
