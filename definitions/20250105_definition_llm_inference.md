# LLM Inference

## Definition

LLM inference refers to the process of using a trained large language model
(LLM) to generate outputs or make predictions based on new input data.
During inference, the model applies the knowledge it learned during training
to respond to specific prompts or queries, such as generating text, answering
questions, or making decisions. Inference typically involves running the model
in a "forward pass," where the input is processed through the model's layers to
produce an output, without further updating the model's parameters.

## Context and Usage

LLM inference is widely used in real-world applications where large pre-trained
models are deployed to serve predictions or responses in real-time. For instance,
chatbots use inference to respond to user queries, while content generation tools
leverage inference to create articles, essays, or summaries based on input prompts.
Inference is also essential in industries like healthcare, finance, and legal, where
LLMs can assist in generating medical reports, performing sentiment analysis, or
summarizing contracts. The efficiency and speed of inference are crucial for applications requiring low-latency responses, such as virtual assistants or recommendation systems.
