Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows users to create and share documents (notebooks) containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It supports multiple programming languages, with Python being the most popular.

## Context and Usage

Jupyter Notebook is widely used in data science, scientific computing, and educational contexts. It provides an interactive environment where users can write and execute code, view results immediately, and document their work with rich text and multimedia elements. This makes it an ideal tool for data analysis, prototyping, teaching, and creating reproducible research.
