# Progressive Delivery

## Definition

Progressive Delivery is an approach in software development that focuses on gradually and incrementally delivering new software features or changes to users. It allows for the controlled rollout of updates, providing teams with the ability to manage who sees what and when. This approach minimizes risks associated with large-scale deployments by offering mechanisms such as feature flags, canary releases, A/B testing, observability, and rollbacks/roll forwards.

Feature Flags: These enable developers to enable or disable specific features for different user groups, providing a safety net for new releases.

Canary Releases: By initially deploying updates to a small subset of users, teams can closely monitor and address any issues before making a full-scale release.

A/B Testing: This allows teams to experiment with different versions of features and compare their performance, aiding in making informed decisions.

Observability: Monitoring the performance of features provides insights into user behavior and system health, enabling teams to optimize their software.

Rollbacks and Roll Forwards: In case any issues arise, quick reversions or advancements can be made without disrupting the overall user experience.

Progressive Delivery offers numerous benefits for both developers and businesses. It enables developers to rapidly push new features to production behind feature flags, promoting a "built for failure" mindset and allowing them to focus on development without immediate exposure. For businesses, Progressive Delivery provides more control over feature exposure and rollout cadence, enabling them to leverage user feedback to shape iterations and drive faster innovation. This approach ultimately results in reduced risk and improved engagement with end-users.

Prominent technology companies, including Microsoft, IBM, JetBrains, Mozilla, and Google, have implemented Progressive Delivery principles successfully in their software development processes.

Although Progressive Delivery is an established approach, it does have its challenges. Successful implementation requires seamless collaboration between developers, operations teams, and business stakeholders, as well as alignment of workflows. The technology landscape supporting Progressive Delivery is continuously evolving, with companies such as LaunchDarkly, Micro Focus, and Microsoft leading the way.

As software development continues to evolve and become more complex, Progressive Delivery offers a promising strategy to balance agility with control. It aligns well with standardized development environments like Daytona, providing a management layer that translates sophisticated routing and delivery workflows into practice. Progressive Delivery remains a strategic approach in the software delivery ecosystem, serving as a cornerstone for efficient, effective, and user-centric software delivery in the future.
