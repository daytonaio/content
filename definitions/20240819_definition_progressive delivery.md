# Progressive Delivery

## Definition

Progressive Delivery is an approach in software development that focuses on
gradually and incrementally delivering new software features or changes to
users. It allows for the controlled rollout of updates, providing teams with the
ability to manage who sees what and when. This approach minimizes risks
associated with large-scale deployments by offering mechanisms such as feature
flags, canary releases, A/B testing, observability, and rollbacks/roll forwards.

Feature Flags: These enable developers to enable or disable specific features
for different user groups, providing a safety net for new releases.

Canary Releases: By initially deploying updates to a small subset of users,
teams can closely monitor and address any issues before making a full-scale
release.

A/B Testing: This allows teams to experiment with different versions of features
and compare their performance, aiding in making informed decisions.

Observability: Monitoring the performance of features provides insights into
user behavior and system health, enabling teams to optimize their software.

Rollbacks and Roll Forwards: In case any issues arise, quick reversions or
advancements can be made without disrupting the overall user experience.

Progressive Delivery offers numerous benefits for both developers and
businesses. It enables developers to rapidly push new features to production
behind feature flags, promoting a "built for failure" mindset and allowing them
to focus on development without immediate exposure. For businesses, Progressive
Delivery provides more control over feature exposure and rollout cadence,
enabling them to leverage user feedback to shape iterations and drive faster
innovation. This approach ultimately results in reduced risk and improved
engagement with end-users.

Prominent technology companies, including Microsoft, IBM, JetBrains, Mozilla,
and Google, have implemented Progressive Delivery principles successfully in
their software development processes.

Although Progressive Delivery is an established approach, it does have its
challenges. Successful implementation requires seamless collaboration between
developers, operations teams, and business stakeholders, as well as alignment of
workflows. The technology landscape supporting Progressive Delivery is
continuously evolving, with companies such as LaunchDarkly, Micro Focus, and
Microsoft leading the way.

As software development continues to evolve and become more complex, Progressive
Delivery offers a promising strategy to balance agility with control. It aligns
well with standardized development environments like Daytona, providing a
management layer that translates sophisticated routing and delivery workflows
into practice. Progressive Delivery remains a strategic approach in the software
delivery ecosystem, serving as a cornerstone for efficient, effective, and
user-centric software delivery in the future.
