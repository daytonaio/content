## Definition

SSH (Secure Shell) is a cryptographic network protocol employed for secure
access to network services over an unsecured network.

SSH enables secure system administration and file transfers over insecure
networks, which is pivotal in modern software development practices. It
facilitates developers in establishing a secure and encrypted connection to
cloud environments and servers, thereby ensuring the confidentiality and
integrity of data transmitted during development operations.

In the context of future software development, SSH is foundational in accessing
and managing cloud-based development environments, supporting the seamless,
efficient, and secure workflow envisioned for shipping quality code at
unprecedented speeds.
