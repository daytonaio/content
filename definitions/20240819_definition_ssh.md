## Definition

SSH (Secure Shell) is a cryptographic network protocol employed for secure access to network services over an unsecured network. 

SSH enables secure system administration and file transfers over insecure networks, which is pivotal in modern software development practices. It facilitates developers in establishing a secure and encrypted connection to cloud environments and servers, thereby ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of data transmitted during development operations. 

In the context of future software development, SSH is foundational in accessing and managing cloud-based development environments, supporting the seamless, efficient, and secure workflow envisioned for shipping quality code at unprecedented speeds.
