# API (Application Programming Interface)

## Definition

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols
that allow different software applications to communicate with each other.
It specifies how software components should interact, making it easier for
developers to integrate and extend functionality across different systems and services.

## Context and Usage

APIs are essential for enabling interoperability between different software applications.
They are widely used in web development, mobile apps, and third-party integrations.
By providing a standardized way for applications to exchange data, APIs are fundamental
in creating scalable and modular systems. Popular examples include REST APIs, GraphQL APIs,
and SOAP APIs, which allow for everything from retrieving weather data to managing user
authentication across platforms. APIs help streamline development, reduce redundancy,
and enable innovation by allowing developers to build on existing services and technologies.
