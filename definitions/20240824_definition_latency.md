title: "Latency"
description: "
Latency refers to the delay between a request being made and the response being received in a system or network. It is typically measured in milliseconds (ms) and represents the time it takes for data to travel from the source to the destination and back. High latency can result in slower response times, affecting the performance and user experience of applications, especially in real-time systems like online gaming, video conferencing, or financial trading. Low latency is crucial for ensuring smooth and efficient operation in time-sensitive applications."
