# OpenVSCode Server

## Definition

OpenVSCode Server is an open-source project that enables developers to run Visual Studio Code (VS Code) in a web browser. Leveraging the power of remote development, it allows coders to access, edit, and manage their codebase from any device with internet connectivity, without the need to install Visual Studio Code locally. This server-based implementation of VS Code provides a familiar, feature-rich development environment accessible through a browser, facilitating a seamless coding experience.

Within the Standardized Development Environments (SDEs) framework, OpenVSCode Server plays a pivotal role by offering a uniform, replicable, and easily accessible coding environment. It aligns with the objectives of SDEs by minimizing setup time, ensuring consistency across development workspaces, and significantly boosting developer velocity. By enabling developers to work in a consistent and standardized environment, regardless of their physical location or device, OpenVSCode Server contributes to overcoming common challenges such as "it works on my machine" problems. It thereby enhances collaboration and productivity across teams and projects.
