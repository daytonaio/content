# Immutable Infrastructure

## Definition

Immutable Infrastructure is an infrastructure architecture approach in which components and configurations are never modified in place. Instead of making changes directly to existing infrastructure elements, any modifications result in the creation of a new, immutable instance. This approach ensures consistency, simplifies management, and reduces the risk of configuration drift.

In regulated industries, such as financial services, healthcare, energy, and government, where strict governance mandates are in place, Immutable Infrastructure plays a crucial role in maintaining a secure, compliant, and productive development environment. By preventing direct modifications to infrastructure components, organizations can reduce the risk of introducing security vulnerabilities or unintentional changes that may lead to non-compliance. Immutable Infrastructure also facilitates better auditability and accountability as each change is traced back to a new, immutable instance.

Implementing Immutable Infrastructure involves creating new instances of components and configurations for each change. This approach allows teams to easily roll back to previous versions if issues arise and gives developers the freedom to experiment without the fear of impacting production systems. Additionally, Immutable Infrastructure promotes reproducibility, scalability, and automation, as configurations are defined as code and can be easily replicated and deployed across different environments.

By standardizing development environments through centralized Development Environment Management, using Immutable Infrastructure along with infrastructure-as-code practices, regulated teams can deliver innovation quickly and securely, while also maintaining compliance and meeting strict regulatory requirements. This approach empowers organizations to navigate the challenges posed by strict governance mandates while embracing the benefits of agile development and emerging technologies.
