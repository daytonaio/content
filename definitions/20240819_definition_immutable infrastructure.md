# Immutable Infrastructure

## Definition

Immutable Infrastructure is an infrastructure architecture approach in which
components and configurations are never modified in place. Instead of making
changes directly to existing infrastructure elements, any modifications result
in the creation of a new, immutable instance. This approach ensures consistency,
simplifies management, and reduces the risk of configuration drift.

In regulated industries, such as financial services, healthcare, energy, and
government, where strict governance mandates are in place, Immutable
Infrastructure plays a crucial role in maintaining a secure, compliant, and
productive development environment. By preventing direct modifications to
infrastructure components, organizations can reduce the risk of introducing
security vulnerabilities or unintentional changes that may lead to
non-compliance. Immutable Infrastructure also facilitates better auditability
and accountability as each change is traced back to a new, immutable instance.

Implementing Immutable Infrastructure involves creating new instances of
components and configurations for each change. This approach allows teams to
easily roll back to previous versions if issues arise and gives developers the
freedom to experiment without the fear of impacting production systems.
Additionally, Immutable Infrastructure promotes reproducibility, scalability,
and automation, as configurations are defined as code and can be easily
replicated and deployed across different environments.

By standardizing development environments through centralized Development
Environment Management, using Immutable Infrastructure along with
infrastructure-as-code practices, regulated teams can deliver innovation quickly
and securely, while also maintaining compliance and meeting strict regulatory
requirements. This approach empowers organizations to navigate the challenges
posed by strict governance mandates while embracing the benefits of agile
development and emerging technologies.
