# Repository

## Definition

A repository refers to a virtual storage space where the Git version control
system manages and tracks changes to a set of files. It is the core component of
Git's distributed version control model, enabling developers to collaborate on
coding projects by keeping a complete record of the codebase's history.

Each repository contains the entire history and full version tracking
capabilities, allowing for changes made by multiple developers to be merged,
compared, and reverted as needed. Repositories can be hosted locally on a
developer's machine, enabling work offline and commit changes, or remotely on
platforms like GitHub for shared access and collaboration. This model
facilitates seamless team collaboration, efficient handling of merge conflicts,
and the flexibility to simultaneously work on various aspects of a project.

Git repositories are essential for managing code in open-source projects and
InnerSource initiatives within organizations, allowing for standardized
development environments and contributing to streamlined project development
workflows.
