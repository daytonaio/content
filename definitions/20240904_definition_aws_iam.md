# AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)

## Definition

AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) is a service provided by AWS that
allows you to manage users, groups, and permissions securely. It enables you to
control who can access your AWS resources and what actions they can perform,
providing fine-grained access control across all AWS services.

## Context and Usage

AWS IAM is crucial for maintaining security and governance in AWS environments.
It is used to create and manage AWS users and groups, assign permissions, and
enforce policies to protect resources. IAM is commonly used in both development
and production environments to ensure that only authorized users have access to
specific AWS resources.
