# Notebook

## Definition

In the context of Jupyter and interactive computing, a notebook is a document that combines executable code, rich text, equations, visualizations, and other multimedia elements in a single file.

## Context and Usage

Notebooks are central to the Jupyter ecosystem and are widely used in data science, scientific research, and education. They allow users to create documents that include live code, explanatory text, and visual outputs, all in a single, shareable format. This makes notebooks ideal for data analysis workflows, creating tutorials, documenting research, and presenting results. The interactive nature of notebooks enables users to execute code cells individually, see results immediately, and iterate quickly on their work.
