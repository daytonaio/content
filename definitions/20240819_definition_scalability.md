# Scalability

## Definition

Scalability refers to the ability of a system, network, or process to handle a growing amount of work or its potential to be enlarged to accommodate that growth. It is a crucial characteristic for businesses and technologies that are experiencing rapid growth or expecting increased demand in the future.

In the context of Daytona, a self-hosted 'Development Environment Management' platform, scalability plays a vital role in enabling organizations to effectively manage and scale their development environments.

The scalability of Dayton impacts both productivity and efficiency. By providing a platform that can seamlessly handle the growing demands of development environments, Daytona allows developers to focus on their work without being hindered by resource limitations or performance bottlenecks.
