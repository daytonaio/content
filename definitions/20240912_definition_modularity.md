# Modularity

## Definition

Modularity refers to a design approach in which a system is structured as
distinct components or modules, each responsible for a specific task. These
modules can be independently created, modified, or replaced without affecting
the entire system.

## Context and Usage

Modularity is commonly applied in software development to ensure systems are
flexible, maintainable, and scalable. In Daytonaâ€™s container registry,
modularity allows reusable project configurations using Docker containers.
Developers can define and reuse modular configurations across different
workspaces, ensuring consistency and faster setup times, while avoiding
redundant builds.
