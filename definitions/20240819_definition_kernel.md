# Kernel

## Definition

In the context of Jupyter Notebook, a kernel is the computational engine responsible for executing code contained in a notebook. It processes the input from code cells and returns the output to the notebook interface.

## Context and Usage

Kernels are a crucial component of the Jupyter ecosystem, providing the backend that powers code execution in notebooks. Different kernels support different programming languages, allowing Jupyter Notebooks to be used with various languages such as Python, R, Julia, and more. When a user runs a code cell in a notebook, the kernel interprets and executes the code, then sends the results back to the notebook interface for display. This separation of the user interface from the execution engine allows for flexibility in language support and enables features like interactive widgets and real-time plotting.
