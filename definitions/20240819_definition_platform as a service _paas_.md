# Platform as a Service (PaaS)

## Definition

Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a cloud computing model where a third-party
provider delivers hardware and software tools to users over the internet. This
model has evolved from its initial focus on complex infrastructure management to
now prioritize simplification, value delivery, and user satisfaction.

In the evolving landscape of technology, platform engineering teams are no
longer limited to infrastructure management. By adopting a platform-as-a-service
(PaaS) mindset, these teams embrace a service provider role, empowering
developers to work more efficiently. PaaS simplifies operations through
automation, allowing developers to deliver value faster. By freeing up time and
energy, platform engineering teams can create more value for end-users and align
their efforts with the organization's broader goals.

Observability has emerged as a crucial aspect of platform engineering, enabling
teams to gain insights into platform performance and behavior. Through
observability practices, platform engineering teams can proactively detect and
mitigate potential issues, resulting in an improved user experience.

Financial considerations also play a significant role in the evolution of
platform engineering. As organizations seek cost optimization and resource
efficiency, platform engineering teams are expected to deliver more value with
fewer resources. By adopting a data-driven approach and analyzing costs and
benefits, these teams can make informed decisions that positively impact the
organization's bottom line.

In addition, sustainability has become a key consideration. Platform engineering
teams are now considering the environmental impact of their infrastructure
choices and implementing practices that support sustainability. By embracing
this responsibility, they contribute to reducing the organization's carbon
footprint and operating more sustainably.

Overall, the evolution of platform engineering towards a PaaS model focuses on
simplification, value delivery, and user satisfaction. Observability ensures
smooth platform operation, financial considerations drive optimization, and
sustainability considerations align the team with environmental goals. As
technology continues to evolve, platform engineering will adapt and refine its
practices, playing a vital role in the future of software development and
organizational success.
