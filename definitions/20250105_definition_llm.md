# LLM (Large Language Models)

## Definition

An LLM (Large Language Model) is a type of artificial intelligence model designed to
understand and generate human-like text based on a given input. These models are trained on
large amounts of data and use advanced architectures, typically based on transformers
(like OpenAI's GPT or Google's BERT), to capture patterns, context, and semantics in language.

## Context and Usage

LLMs excel at a wide range of tasks, such as answering questions, writing essays,
translating languages, coding, summarizing content, and engaging in conversation.
They rely on billions of parameters—adjustable weights in their neural networks—to
process and generate text with remarkable accuracy and fluency. Their applications span industries, powering chatbots, content generation tools, code completion systems, and more, making them integral to advancements in natural language processing (NLP).
