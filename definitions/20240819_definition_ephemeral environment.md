# Ephemeral Environment

## Definition

An ephemeral environment refers to a temporary and disposable environment that
is created on-demand and exists only for a short duration to fulfill a specific
purpose or execute a particular function. In the context of software
development, ephemeral environments are commonly utilized in containerized or
cloud-based setups. These environments provide developers with the flexibility
to dynamically allocate and efficiently utilize computing resources as and when
needed, without incurring extra costs or maintaining long-term infrastructure.

In ephemeral environments, the focus is on creating a lightweight and transient
environment that can be easily provisioned and torn down. This approach ensures
efficient resource utilization, eliminates the need for manual setup or
configuration, and promotes isolation and reproducibility. Ephemeral
environments are particularly beneficial for tasks such as testing, continuous
integration, and deployment, where rapid iteration and scalability are
essential.

When managing secrets and sensitive information in ephemeral environments, tools
like Doppler can be used to securely store and retrieve secrets, such as API
tokens, database strings, and certificate files. By integrating with tools like
Daytona, a standardized development environment platform, Doppler enables
developers to easily configure and manage secrets within ephemeral environments,
enhancing security and simplifying the workflow.

In summary, ephemeral environments provide the agility and efficiency required
for modern software development by facilitating the rapid deployment and
disposal of temporary computing environments. They play a crucial role in
enabling seamless collaboration, testing, and deployment while ensuring the
secure management of sensitive information through tools like Doppler.
