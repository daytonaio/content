# Shift Left

## Definition

Shift Left is a software development practice that aims to enhance the
efficiency and quality of the development process by establishing a proactive
approach to identifying and addressing potential issues. Traditionally, software
testing, security evaluations, and quality assurance activities were performed
towards the end of the development lifecycle. However, this sequential approach
often resulted in delays, increased costs, and lower software quality.

In contrast, the Shift Left approach proposes that these activities be shifted
earlier in the development process, allowing for earlier detection and
resolution of issues. By integrating testing, security evaluations, and quality
assurance activities right from the start, software teams can identify
vulnerabilities, functional inconsistencies, and other defects before they
escalate into larger problems.

This shift in perspective helps developers address issues earlier, streamline
the development process, and ultimately improve the overall quality of the
software being developed. By catching and resolving issues at an earlier stage,
Shift Left enables teams to minimize the time and resources required to address
problems that would otherwise have been identified at a later stage. As a
result, software projects can be delivered more efficiently, cost-effectively,
and with improved user satisfaction.

In addition to reducing costs and enhancing software quality, Shift Left also
emphasizes collaboration and communication among various stakeholders. By
involving testers, security experts, and quality assurance professionals earlier
in the process, Shift Left fosters a culture of shared responsibility and
collective ownership. This multidisciplinary approach encourages continuous
feedback, identification of potential risks, and faster decision-making.

Overall, Shift Left promotes a more proactive and integrated approach to
software development, enabling teams to identify and resolve issues earlier in
the development process. By bringing testing, security evaluations, and quality
assurance activities "left" in the timeline, this practice reduces costs,
improves software quality, and encourages collaboration among different
stakeholders.
