# Shift Left

## Definition

Shift Left is a software development practice that aims to enhance the efficiency and quality of the development process by establishing a proactive approach to identifying and addressing potential issues. Traditionally, software testing, security evaluations, and quality assurance activities were performed towards the end of the development lifecycle. However, this sequential approach often resulted in delays, increased costs, and lower software quality.

In contrast, the Shift Left approach proposes that these activities be shifted earlier in the development process, allowing for earlier detection and resolution of issues. By integrating testing, security evaluations, and quality assurance activities right from the start, software teams can identify vulnerabilities, functional inconsistencies, and other defects before they escalate into larger problems.

This shift in perspective helps developers address issues earlier, streamline the development process, and ultimately improve the overall quality of the software being developed. By catching and resolving issues at an earlier stage, Shift Left enables teams to minimize the time and resources required to address problems that would otherwise have been identified at a later stage. As a result, software projects can be delivered more efficiently, cost-effectively, and with improved user satisfaction.

In addition to reducing costs and enhancing software quality, Shift Left also emphasizes collaboration and communication among various stakeholders. By involving testers, security experts, and quality assurance professionals earlier in the process, Shift Left fosters a culture of shared responsibility and collective ownership. This multidisciplinary approach encourages continuous feedback, identification of potential risks, and faster decision-making.

Overall, Shift Left promotes a more proactive and integrated approach to software development, enabling teams to identify and resolve issues earlier in the development process. By bringing testing, security evaluations, and quality assurance activities "left" in the timeline, this practice reduces costs, improves software quality, and encourages collaboration among different stakeholders.
