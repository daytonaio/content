# Data Analysis

## Definition

Data analysis is the process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, drawing conclusions, and supporting decision-making.

## Context and Usage

In the context of Jupyter Notebook and data science, data analysis involves using various statistical and computational techniques to explore datasets, identify patterns, and extract insights. It often includes steps such as data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, statistical modeling, and data visualization. Tools like Jupyter Notebook facilitate this process by allowing analysts to combine code execution with narrative explanations and visual outputs.
