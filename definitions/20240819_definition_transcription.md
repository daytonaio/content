# Transcription

## Definition

Transcription is the process of converting spoken language (audio or video) into written text. This can be done manually by a person listening to the audio and typing out the words, or automatically using speech recognition software and AI models.

## Context and Usage

Transcription is commonly used in various fields such as content creation, legal documentation, journalism, academic research, and customer service. In content creation, transcription helps generate subtitles for videos, making them accessible to a wider audience. In legal settings, transcriptions are essential for creating official records of proceedings, depositions, and interviews. In academia, transcribing interviews and discussions is crucial for qualitative research analysis. With advancements in AI, automated transcription tools have become increasingly popular, offering fast and accurate conversions of speech to text, which can be further edited, analyzed, or published as needed.
