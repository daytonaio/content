# Python

## Definition

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its
readability and ease of use. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first
released in 1991. Python's syntax emphasizes code readability and simplicity,
allowing developers to express concepts in fewer lines of code compared to
languages like C++ or Java.

Python is widely used in various fields, including web development, data
science, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and automation. Its
extensive standard library and vibrant community contribute to its popularity,
making it a go-to language for both beginners and experienced developers.

### Features

- **Readability:** Python's syntax is designed to be intuitive and clean, making
  it easier to read and write.

- **Versatility:** Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including
  procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

- **Extensive Libraries:** Python's standard library is rich, and there are many
  third-party libraries available for a wide range of applications.

- **Community Support:** Python has a large and active community, offering
  extensive resources for learning and problem-solving.

In a Devcontainer, Python is frequently used to install packages, manage
environments, and automate setup processes, making it an essential part of the
development workflow.
