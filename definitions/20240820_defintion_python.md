Python is widely used in various fields, including web development, data
science, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and automation. Its
extensive standard library and vibrant community contribute to its popularity,
making it a go-to language for both beginners and experienced developers.

### Features

- **Readability:** Python's syntax is designed to be intuitive and clean, making
  it easier to read and write.

- **Versatility:** Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including
  procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

- **Extensive Libraries:** Python's standard library is rich, and there are many
  third-party libraries available for a wide range of applications.

- **Community Support:** Python has a large and active community, offering
  extensive resources for learning and problem-solving.

In a Devcontainer, Python is frequently used to install packages, manage
environments, and automate setup processes, making it an essential part of the
development workflow.
