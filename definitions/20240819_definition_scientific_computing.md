# Scientific Computing

## Definition

Scientific computing, also known as computational science, refers to the use of computers to solve complex scientific problems through mathematical models, numerical methods, simulations, and data analysis.

## Context and Usage

In the realm of Jupyter Notebook and data science, scientific computing often involves using programming languages like Python, along with specialized libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and Pandas, to perform complex calculations, run simulations, and analyze large datasets. Jupyter Notebooks provide an ideal environment for scientific computing tasks, allowing researchers to document their methodology, share results, and create reproducible research.
