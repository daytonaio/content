# Works on My Machine Syndrome

## Definition

"Works on my machine" syndrome describes a common phenomenon in software
development where a developer claims that a piece of code or application
functions properly on their own local development environment, but it fails to
operate as expected in other environments, such as teammates' machines, testing
stages, or production.

This issue often arises due to discrepancies in environment configurations,
software versions, operating system differences, or overlooked dependencies. The
syndrome highlights the challenges of ensuring consistency across development,
testing, and production environments, emphasizing the importance of shared,
standardized development practices and tools, like Docker or environment
orchestration platforms such as Daytona, to mitigate such discrepancies.
