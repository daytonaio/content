# Docker in Docker

## Definition

Docker in Docker is a concept where a Docker container runs inside another
Docker container. This technique can be used in development environments to
create isolated and consistent workspaces or to test Docker itself. It is an
advanced use case of containerization technology, allowing developers to manage
Docker containers from within a container, thus providing an additional layer of
isolation and flexibility. Docker in Docker plays a role in standardized
development environments by enabling the creation of reproducible and portable
workspaces that encapsulate all necessary dependencies and configurations.
