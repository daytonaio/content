# Docker in Docker

## Definition

Docker in Docker is a concept where a Docker container runs inside another Docker container. This technique can be used in development environments to create isolated and consistent workspaces or to test Docker itself. It is an advanced use case of containerization technology, allowing developers to manage Docker containers from within a container, thus providing an additional layer of isolation and flexibility. Docker in Docker plays a role in standardized development environments by enabling the creation of reproducible and portable workspaces that encapsulate all necessary dependencies and configurations.
