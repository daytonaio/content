# Open Core

## Definition

The open core model is a business strategy employed by companies engaged in open
source software development. Under this model, a company offers a foundational
version of its software as open source, which can be freely accessed, used, and
modified by the community. This core, open-source version includes essential
features and capabilities but may lack more advanced functionalities.

To monetize their software, companies provide additional features, tools, or
services as proprietary extensions or premium versions. Users can purchase these
enhanced elements to unlock more sophisticated capabilities, enterprise-grade
features, or professional support.

Free Core Software: The basic, open-source version is freely available,
fostering community contribution and encouraging widespread adoption.

Proprietary Extensions: Advanced features, add-ons, and integrations are offered
as proprietary options, differentiating the free and paid versions.

Monetization Strategy: The sale of premium features, customizations, and
professional support provides a revenue stream for the company.

Community Engagement: The open core approach promotes collaboration and
innovation within the developer community, attracting contributions that improve
the foundational codebase.

Balance of Control and Openness: It allows businesses to maintain control over
their core intellectual property while benefiting from the openness of the
software ecosystem.

Many modern companies leveraging open source software adopt the open core model
to reconcile the community-driven benefits of open source with the need for a
sustainable business model. For example, a cloud-based development tool might
provide its basic orchestration and configuration management features as open
source. At the same time, it offers enterprise customers additional capabilities
such as advanced security protocols, scalability enhancements, and dedicated
support as paid options.

This approach ensures that the core tool remains accessible for innovation and
wide adoption while generating revenue through the proprietary components, which
are crucial for the company's growth and sustainability.
