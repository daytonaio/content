title: "Isolation"
description: "In the context of software development environments, isolation refers to the segregation of development workspaces from one another and from the host environment. This is a crucial aspect of security within cloud development environments, as it prevents potential vulnerabilities from affecting other workspaces or the underlying infrastructure. Isolated environments, as part of standardized development environments, ensure that developers can work in a secure and controlled space that minimizes the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches."

# Isolation

## Definition

In the context of software development environments, isolation refers to the segregation of development workspaces from one another and from the host environment. This is a crucial aspect of security within cloud development environments, as it prevents potential vulnerabilities from affecting other workspaces or the underlying infrastructure. Isolated environments, as part of standardized development environments, ensure that developers can work in a secure and controlled space that minimizes the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches.
