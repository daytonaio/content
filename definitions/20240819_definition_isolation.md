title: 'Isolation'
description:
  'In the context of software development environments, isolation refers to the
  segregation of development workspaces from one another and from the host
  environment. This is a crucial aspect of security within cloud development
  environments, as it prevents potential vulnerabilities from affecting other
  workspaces or the underlying infrastructure. Isolated environments, as part of
  standardized development environments, ensure that developers can work in a
  secure and controlled space that minimizes the risk of unauthorized access or
  data breaches.'

# Isolation

## Definition

In the context of software development environments, isolation refers to the
segregation of development workspaces from one another and from the host
environment. This is a crucial aspect of security within cloud development
environments, as it prevents potential vulnerabilities from affecting other
workspaces or the underlying infrastructure. Isolated environments, as part of
standardized development environments, ensure that developers can work in a
secure and controlled space that minimizes the risk of unauthorized access or
data breaches.
