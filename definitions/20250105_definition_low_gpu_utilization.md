# Low GPU Utilization

## Definition

Low GPU utilization refers to a state where a GPU is using only a small percentage
of its processing capacity, often under 30%, even during tasks that might otherwise
demand high performance. This typically occurs when the GPU is underutilized due to
bottlenecks in other parts of the system, such as the CPU, memory, or software
in efficiencies. It can also result from running lightweight tasks that do not
require significant GPU resources or when the GPU is idle.

## Context and Usage

Low GPU utilization can be a sign of inefficient resource allocation or system
bottlenecks, especially in compute-intensive applications like gaming, rendering
or machine learning. For instance, in machine learning workflows, low utilization
may occur if the CPU cannot feed data to the GPU fast enough or if the batch sizes
are too small. On the other hand, low utilization is normal during tasks that rely
more on the CPU or when the system is performing background processes. Identifying and addressing the causes of low utilization can help improve performance and ensure that the GPU is used efficiently for the intended workload.
