# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

## Definition

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) refers to a structured and systematic
approach used by software development teams to create high-quality software
systems. It encompasses the entire process, from the initial requirements
gathering stage to the continuous maintenance and support of the deployed
software.

SDLC is divided into several distinct phases that allow developers to
effectively manage and control the software development process:

Requirements Gathering: In this phase, the development team interacts with
stakeholders and clients to understand their needs and document the functional
and non-functional requirements of the software system.

Design: Once the requirements are gathered, the development team creates the
architectural and design specifications of the software. This includes
determining the overall structure of the system, as well as the individual
components and their interactions.

Coding: In this phase, the actual implementation of the software system takes
place. Developers write code according to the design specifications, following
best practices and coding standards.

Testing: The software is thoroughly tested to ensure that it functions as
intended and meets the defined requirements. This phase involves various testing
activities, such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and
acceptance testing.

Deployment: After successful testing, the software is prepared for deployment.
This involves packaging the software, creating installation packages, and
delivering it to users or clients.

Maintenance: Once deployed, the software enters the maintenance phase. This
phase involves monitoring its performance, addressing user feedback, fixing
issues and bugs, implementing patches and updates, and providing technical
support.

Throughout the SDLC, project management techniques and methodologies are applied
to effectively plan, track, and control the progress of software development.
This ensures that the final product aligns with the requirements and
expectations of stakeholders and clients.

By following the SDLC, software development teams can streamline their
processes, improve collaboration, minimize risks, and deliver software systems
that are robust, reliable, and of high quality.

Overall, the Software Development Life Cycle provides a systematic framework
that enables software development teams to efficiently manage the entire
software development process, from inception to maintenance.
