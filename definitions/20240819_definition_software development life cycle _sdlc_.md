# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

## Definition

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) refers to a structured and systematic approach used by software development teams to create high-quality software systems. It encompasses the entire process, from the initial requirements gathering stage to the continuous maintenance and support of the deployed software.

SDLC is divided into several distinct phases that allow developers to effectively manage and control the software development process:

Requirements Gathering: In this phase, the development team interacts with stakeholders and clients to understand their needs and document the functional and non-functional requirements of the software system.

Design: Once the requirements are gathered, the development team creates the architectural and design specifications of the software. This includes determining the overall structure of the system, as well as the individual components and their interactions.

Coding: In this phase, the actual implementation of the software system takes place. Developers write code according to the design specifications, following best practices and coding standards.

Testing: The software is thoroughly tested to ensure that it functions as intended and meets the defined requirements. This phase involves various testing activities, such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.

Deployment: After successful testing, the software is prepared for deployment. This involves packaging the software, creating installation packages, and delivering it to users or clients.

Maintenance: Once deployed, the software enters the maintenance phase. This phase involves monitoring its performance, addressing user feedback, fixing issues and bugs, implementing patches and updates, and providing technical support.

Throughout the SDLC, project management techniques and methodologies are applied to effectively plan, track, and control the progress of software development. This ensures that the final product aligns with the requirements and expectations of stakeholders and clients.

By following the SDLC, software development teams can streamline their processes, improve collaboration, minimize risks, and deliver software systems that are robust, reliable, and of high quality.

Overall, the Software Development Life Cycle provides a systematic framework that enables software development teams to efficiently manage the entire software development process, from inception to maintenance.
