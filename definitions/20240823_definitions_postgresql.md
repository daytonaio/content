# PostgreSQL

## Definition

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source object-relational database management
system (ORDBMS) that enables the storage and manipulation of data in a
structured and controlled manner.

### Key Features

- **Relational Database:** Stores data in tables with well-defined relationships
  between them.

- **SQL Support:** Supports standard SQL (Structured Query Language) for
  querying and manipulating data.

- **ACID Compliance:** Ensures database transactions are processed reliably and
  securely.

- **Extensibility:** Allows for custom data types, functions, and operators.

- **Scalability:** Supports large databases and high-performance applications.

## Context and Usage

PostgreSQL is typically used in a variety of contexts, including:

- **Web applications:** PostgreSQL is a popular choice for powering dynamic web
  applications and websites, due to its ability to handle high traffic and large
  volumes of data.

- **Data analytics:** PostgreSQL is used in data analytics and business
  intelligence applications, due to its support for complex queries and data
  analysis.

- **Enterprise applications:** PostgreSQL is used in large-scale enterprise
  applications, due to its ability to handle large volumes of data and support
  for advanced features such as replication and partitioning. PostgreSQL is
  applied in practice through the use of SQL commands, which are used to create,
  modify, and query databases. It also supports a variety of programming
  languages, including Python, Java, and C++, making it a versatile choice for a
  wide range of applications.
