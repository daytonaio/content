# Kubernetes

## Definition

Kubernetes is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling,
and management of containerized applications. It is designed to manage clusters
of containers, grouping them together for easy management and discovery.
Kubernetes provides a robust set of tools and features for managing the
lifecycle of applications, including automatic scaling, load balancing, and
self-healing capabilities.

With Kubernetes, developers can deploy and manage containerized applications
across multiple hosts, abstracting away the underlying infrastructure
complexities. Kubernetes simplifies the process of scaling applications in
response to changing demands, allowing developers to easily increase or decrease
the number of container instances based on resource utilization.

One of the main advantages of Kubernetes is its flexibility and portability. It
supports a wide range of container runtimes, allowing developers to use their
preferred container technology. Kubernetes also offers a declarative approach to
application management, allowing developers to define the desired state of their
applications using YAML or JSON manifests.

In summary, Kubernetes is a powerful platform for automating container
orchestration, providing developers with a robust and scalable environment for
deploying and managing containerized applications. Its flexibility, portability,
and rich set of features make it a popular choice for organizations deploying
and managing containerized applications at scale.
