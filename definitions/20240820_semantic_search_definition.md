# Semantic Search

## Definition

Semantic search is an advanced information retrieval technique that aims to understand the intent and contextual meaning behind a user's search query, rather than just matching keywords. It uses natural language processing and machine learning to interpret the semantics (meaning) of both the query and the searchable content.

## Context and Usage

In the context of information retrieval and AI applications, semantic search is used to:

1. Improve search accuracy by understanding the user's intent, even when the exact keywords aren't present in the target content.
2. Handle natural language queries more effectively, including conversational or complex multi-part questions.
3. Provide more relevant search results by considering context, synonyms, and related concepts.
4. Enhance user experience in search engines, e-commerce platforms, and knowledge management systems.

Semantic search is implemented using various techniques, including:

- Word embeddings and sentence embeddings to capture meaning in vector space.
- Knowledge graphs to represent relationships between concepts.
- Machine learning models trained on large datasets to understand language nuances.

This technology is crucial in modern search engines, content recommendation systems, and AI-powered assistants, where understanding the true meaning behind user queries is essential for providing accurate and helpful responses.
