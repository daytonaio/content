# Git

## Definition

Git is a widely used distributed version control system that developers use to
manage and track changes to code. It enables team collaboration and version
control, allowing multiple developers to work on the same codebase
simultaneously and keeping track of all modifications made throughout the
development process.

Unlike centralized version control systems, which rely on a single server to
store code and track changes, Git is distributed, meaning that every developer
has a complete copy of the codebase and its entire history on their local
machine. This decentralization allows developers to work offline and make local
commits before pushing their changes to a shared repository.

Git uses its own command-line interface (CLI) and supports various graphical
user interfaces (GUIs) to interact with repositories. It operates through a
series of commands that enable developers to create branches, merge changes,
track modifications, and collaborate with other team members.

Git provides features like branching and merging, which allow developers to work
on different features or bug fixes simultaneously and then integrate their
changes back into the main codebase. It also offers support for conflict
resolution, enabling team members to handle conflicting changes made to the same
file.

By using Git, developers can track the entire history of a codebase, revert to
earlier versions of code if needed, and collaborate with others seamlessly.
Git's popularity stems from its flexibility, efficiency, and ability to handle
projects of any size, from small personal repositories to large enterprise-scale
codebases.
