# Natural Language Processing

## Definition

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence focused on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.

## Context and Usage

NLP is used in various applications like chatbots, translation services, sentiment analysis, and voice recognition systems. It plays a crucial role in enhancing human-computer interaction by allowing machines to process and respond to language in a way that is both natural and meaningful.
