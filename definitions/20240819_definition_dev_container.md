# Dev Container

## Definition

A dev container is a containerized development environment that encapsulates all the tools, libraries, and configurations needed for a specific project or technology stack.

## Context and Usage

In the context of Jupyter Notebook and software development, dev containers provide a consistent and reproducible environment across different machines. They simplify the setup process by packaging all dependencies and configurations, ensuring that everyone working on a project has the same development environment. This is particularly useful for Jupyter Notebook projects, as it can include the necessary Python version, libraries, and Jupyter extensions, making it easier to share and collaborate on data science and scientific computing projects.
