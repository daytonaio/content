# Continuous delivery (CD)

## Definition

Continuous delivery (CD) is a software engineering practice in which incremental
code changes are built, tested, and deployed automatically to production
environments using progressive delivery techniques. It enables rapid delivery of
features and fixes to users by reducing manual handoffs and allowing for
controlled, incremental releases.

CD involves the implementation of feedback loops at various stages of the
software delivery process, including development, testing, and deployment. By
tracking metrics such as cycle time, work in progress, throughput, and
consistency, teams can quantify their developer velocity and identify areas for
improvement.

To improve CD, teams can set specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and
time-bound (SMART) goals that align with business outcomes. They can automate
and simplify processes, encourage collaboration and continuous learning,
prioritize technical debt reduction, and invest in the right tools and
technologies.

The Daytona developer platform supports CD by providing optimized workflows and
enhanced collaboration capabilities. It offers templated workspaces for
consistent environments, frictionless collaboration through integrated tools,
automation of testing and deployments, isolation controls for focus, and
built-in best practices for productivity.

By optimizing CD practices, teams can significantly improve their developer
velocity, resulting in faster innovation, improved quality, reduced costs,
increased customer satisfaction, and higher developer engagement.
