# Virtual Environment

## Definition

A virtual environment is an isolated workspace within a computer system that allows you to install and manage specific versions of Python packages and dependencies without affecting the system-wide Python installation or other projects.

## Context and Usage

Virtual environments are commonly used in Python development to create isolated environments for different projects, ensuring that each project can have its own dependencies, regardless of what other projects require. This is particularly important when working on multiple projects that might require different versions of the same package or library. By using virtual environments, developers can avoid conflicts between dependencies and ensure that their projects are portable and easy to reproduce on different systems. Virtual environments are created and managed using tools like `venv` or `virtualenv`, and they are activated whenever you work on a specific project to ensure the correct environment is used.
