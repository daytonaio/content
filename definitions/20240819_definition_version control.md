# Version Control

## Definition

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over
time. It allows developers to recall specific versions later and track changes
made by different team members.

In software development, version control is crucial for managing code and other
important project files. It enables collaboration among team members by
providing a centralized repository where they can access the latest version of a
file, make changes, and track those changes over time.

Version control systems (VCS) such as Git and Mercurial offer features like
branching and merging, which allow developers to work on different versions of a
codebase simultaneously and later combine their changes seamlessly. This ensures
that different versions of the codebase can coexist and be managed effectively.

By using version control, developers can easily track changes made to a file,
revert to a previous version if needed, identify who made a specific change, and
collaborate more efficiently within a team. It also improves code quality, as
developers can review changes before they are incorporated into the main
codebase.

In addition to code, version control systems can also manage other project
files, such as documentation, configuration files, and media assets. This
provides a comprehensive history and audit trail of all changes made to the
project.

Overall, version control is an essential tool in modern software development,
enabling collaboration, accountability, and the ability to manage complex
projects with multiple contributors effectively.
