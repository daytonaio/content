# Version Control

## Definition

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time. It allows developers to recall specific versions later and track changes made by different team members.

In software development, version control is crucial for managing code and other important project files. It enables collaboration among team members by providing a centralized repository where they can access the latest version of a file, make changes, and track those changes over time.

Version control systems (VCS) such as Git and Mercurial offer features like branching and merging, which allow developers to work on different versions of a codebase simultaneously and later combine their changes seamlessly. This ensures that different versions of the codebase can coexist and be managed effectively.

By using version control, developers can easily track changes made to a file, revert to a previous version if needed, identify who made a specific change, and collaborate more efficiently within a team. It also improves code quality, as developers can review changes before they are incorporated into the main codebase.

In addition to code, version control systems can also manage other project files, such as documentation, configuration files, and media assets. This provides a comprehensive history and audit trail of all changes made to the project.

Overall, version control is an essential tool in modern software development, enabling collaboration, accountability, and the ability to manage complex projects with multiple contributors effectively.
