# GPU driver

## Definition

GPU drivers are a software component that act as a bridge between the operating system
and the GPU hardware, enabling communication and translating high-level instructions
into machine-readable commands that the GPU can execute. It ensures that the GPU
operates correctly and efficiently by managing tasks such as rendering graphics,
processing computations, and interacting with other hardware components.
GPU drivers are specific to the manufacturer (e.g., NVIDIA, AMD, or Intel) and must be kept updated to ensure compatibility with the latest software and performance improvements.

## Context and Usage

GPU drivers are essential for gaming, 3D rendering, machine learning, and other
GPU-accelerated tasks, as they optimize performance and support new features.
For instance, updated drivers can enhance game graphics, fix bugs, and improve
the stability of applications that rely on GPU resources. In professional contexts,
such as scientific computing or AI model training, compatible and well-optimized drivers
ensure seamless integration with software frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Properly installed and updated drivers are critical to fully leveraging GPU capabilities across diverse workloads.
