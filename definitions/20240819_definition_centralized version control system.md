# Centralized Version Control System

## Definition

A centralized version control system (CVCS) is a system used in software
development to manage and track changes to codebases. Unlike distributed version
control systems (DVCS) where each user has a complete copy of the repository, in
a CVCS, there is a single central repository that stores all versions of files.
Users check out files from this central repository to work on them locally, and
then they commit their changes back to the repository to make them available to
other users.

In a technology-driven company where smooth communication and operational
efficiency are paramount, the choice of version control system plays a
significant role. A CVCS, by centralizing the storage of files, offers
simplicity and a straightforward setup that can be beneficial for teams not
requiring the full history of the repository locally. However, it necessitates
robust backup strategies and can become a bottleneck, contrasting with tools
that automate and streamline processes, like Semantic Release. Teams using a
CVCS must carefully integrate it with their issue trackers and continuous
integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) platforms to ensure real-time updates
and efficient team synchronization, which are critical for aligning engineering
teams with other departments and maintaining high velocity and quality in
software development.
