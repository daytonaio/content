# Centralized Version Control System

## Definition

A centralized version control system (CVCS) is a system used in software development to manage and track changes to codebases. Unlike distributed version control systems (DVCS) where each user has a complete copy of the repository, in a CVCS, there is a single central repository that stores all versions of files. Users check out files from this central repository to work on them locally, and then they commit their changes back to the repository to make them available to other users.

In a technology-driven company where smooth communication and operational efficiency are paramount, the choice of version control system plays a significant role. A CVCS, by centralizing the storage of files, offers simplicity and a straightforward setup that can be beneficial for teams not requiring the full history of the repository locally. However, it necessitates robust backup strategies and can become a bottleneck, contrasting with tools that automate and streamline processes, like Semantic Release. Teams using a CVCS must carefully integrate it with their issue trackers and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) platforms to ensure real-time updates and efficient team synchronization, which are critical for aligning engineering teams with other departments and maintaining high velocity and quality in software development.
