# Webhook

## Definition

A webhook is an HTTP callback, a simple yet powerful mechanism that allows a web
application or service to provide real-time information to other applications or
services by pushing data to them.

Webhooks are triggered by specific events within a software environment—when
event X occurs, it prompts an immediate data transmission from one application
to another over the web. Essentially, they operate as a "phone call" made
directly from one application to another to share data or trigger actions
automatically when certain conditions are met, without the need for continuous
polling or manual data retrieval.

In the context of integrating services for example in the case of integrating
Cal.com and Supabase, a webhook could be used to inform your application about
events such as new appointments or changes in Cal.com. This notification allows
the receiving application to automatically process the information, update
databases, or even trigger additional workflows without requiring manual
intervention, thereby enabling a more dynamic and real-time data interaction
between the connected platforms.

By facilitating instant communications and actions triggered by specific events,
webhooks substantially reduce the complexity and time associated with setting up
integrations, thus directly contributing to a more favorable developer
experience.
