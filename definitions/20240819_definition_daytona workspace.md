# Daytona Workspace

## Definition

A Daytona Workspace refers to a highly configurable and sandboxed coding
environment provided by the Daytona development environment management platform.
This workspace is tailored to streamline the development process by offering an
instantly accessible, pre-configured setup that integrates seamlessly with
Visual Studio Code (VS Code) or any other IDEs such as JetBrains suite of IDEs.

It is designed to facilitate coding without the need for extensive installations
or permissions setup, thus enabling developers to focus on their code
immediately. Key features include tight integration with IDE for efficient
management of the Daytona workspace directly within the editor, support for
managing and switching between multiple Daytona profiles or installations,
automatic environment setup, port forwarding for easier collaboration, and a
simplified workflow for connecting similar to a remote SSH server.

Daytona Workspaces supports the unique needs of developers and teams by allowing
easy switching among different projects or team contexts, thereby enhancing
productivity and collaboration in software development endeavors.
