# LLM (Large Language Model)

## Definition

A Large Language Model (LLM) is a type of artificial intelligence model trained on vast datasets
of text to understand, generate, and interact in human-like language. LLMs use deep learning techniques,
particularly transformer-based architectures, to predict and create coherent and contextually relevant responses.  

## Context and Usage

LLMs are used in a variety of applications, including chatbots, virtual assistants, text summarization, translation,
and creative content generation. Their capability to understand context and generate text makes them valuable tools
in industries such as technology, marketing, and education. Popular LLMs include OpenAI's GPT series, which powers
many conversational and generative AI platforms.
