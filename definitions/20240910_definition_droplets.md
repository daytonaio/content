# Droplets

## Definition

Droplets are virtual private servers (VPS) provided by DigitalOcean, which can
be used to deploy applications, host websites, or run any software that requires
cloud-based infrastructure. Each droplet is a fully isolated instance with its
own dedicated resources such as CPU, RAM, and storage.

## Context and Usage

Droplets are the core compute resource in DigitalOcean, used by developers to
build and scale their applications in the cloud. They can be configured with
different operating systems, pre-installed with popular development frameworks,
and integrated with other DigitalOcean services like managed databases, block
storage, and monitoring. Droplets are versatile and scalable, allowing users to
select the optimal size and configuration based on their workload and budget.
