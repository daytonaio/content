# Embeddings

## Definition

Embeddings are dense vector representations of data (such as words, sentences, or images) in a continuous, low-dimensional space. These vectors capture semantic and relational information about the data, allowing machines to process and compare complex information more effectively.

## Context and Usage

In machine learning and AI applications, embeddings are used to:

1. Represent complex data in a format that neural networks can process efficiently.
2. Capture semantic relationships between different pieces of data.
3. Enable similarity comparisons between different data points.
4. Facilitate transfer learning by providing pre-trained representations of data.

Embeddings are crucial in various AI tasks, including:

- Natural Language Processing (NLP): Word embeddings and sentence embeddings help in understanding context and meaning in text.
- Recommendation Systems: Item embeddings allow for content-based recommendations.
- Image and Video Processing: Visual embeddings represent images or video frames in a compact form.
- Search Engines: Embeddings enable semantic search capabilities, improving result relevance.

By transforming raw data into these dense vector representations, embeddings make it possible for AI systems to understand and process complex information in ways that more closely mimic human understanding.
