# Open Source

## Definition

Open source refers to software for which the original source code is made freely
available and may be redistributed and modified. The core ethos of open-source
software revolves around collaboration, transparency, and community-driven
improvement. This approach allows developers to examine, alter, and enhance the
software, resulting in rapid innovation and widespread adoption across the
industry.

Daytona, a development environment manager, has transitioned to an open-source
model to harness the power of community collaboration. By making its codebase
publicly available under the Apache 2.0 license, Daytona invites developers
worldwide to contribute to its growth, ensuring that the tool adapitates rapidly
to the diverse needs of its users. This move empowers developers to customize
and extend Daytona, facilitating a more flexible and innovative development
environment. The open-source journey of Daytona reflects its commitment to
sharing advancements and fostering a global community that shapes the future of
development environments collectively.

Why Open Source?

The team behind Daytona believes that innovation flourishes through
collaboration. Open-sourcing Daytona allows developers—not just within the
organization but globally—to contribute to its development, thus breaking down
proprietary barriers and promoting an inclusive, community-oriented evolution of
the software.

Benefits of Open Source:

Fosters Innovation: Enables developers to modify and improve the software,
sparking new ideas and solutions.

Promotes Standards: Often leads to the establishment of widely accepted
standards within the industry.

Increased Security: With more contributors reviewing the code, vulnerabilities
can be identified and fixed more promptly.

Avoids Lock-In: Users are not tied to one provider's ecosystem, allowing more
flexibility and control.
