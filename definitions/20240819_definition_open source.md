# Open Source

## Definition

Open source refers to software for which the original source code is made freely available and may be redistributed and modified. The core ethos of open-source software revolves around collaboration, transparency, and community-driven improvement. This approach allows developers to examine, alter, and enhance the software, resulting in rapid innovation and widespread adoption across the industry.

Daytona, a development environment manager, has transitioned to an open-source model to harness the power of community collaboration. By making its codebase publicly available under the Apache 2.0 license, Daytona invites developers worldwide to contribute to its growth, ensuring that the tool adapitates rapidly to the diverse needs of its users. This move empowers developers to customize and extend Daytona, facilitating a more flexible and innovative development environment. The open-source journey of Daytona reflects its commitment to sharing advancements and fostering a global community that shapes the future of development environments collectively.

Why Open Source?

The team behind Daytona believes that innovation flourishes through collaboration. Open-sourcing Daytona allows developers—not just within the organization but globally—to contribute to its development, thus breaking down proprietary barriers and promoting an inclusive, community-oriented evolution of the software.

Benefits of Open Source:

Fosters Innovation: Enables developers to modify and improve the software, sparking new ideas and solutions.

Promotes Standards: Often leads to the establishment of widely accepted standards within the industry.

Increased Security: With more contributors reviewing the code, vulnerabilities can be identified and fixed more promptly.

Avoids Lock-In: Users are not tied to one provider's ecosystem, allowing more flexibility and control.
