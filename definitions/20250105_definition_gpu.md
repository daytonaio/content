# GPU (Graphical Processing Unit)

## Definition

GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) are specialized hardware designed for parallel to
computation to accelerate the rendering of images, video, and animations. Originally
developed to handle the intense mathematical calculations required for rendering
graphics in real-time like for video games.

## Context and Usage

GPUs were originally developed for rendering graphics in applications like gaming and video editing.
Over time, their high-performance parallel architecture has made them indispensable in various fields beyond graphics.
GPUs are now widely used in scientific simulations, cryptocurrency mining, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning, where they accelerate tasks like model training and inference.
In these contexts, GPUs handle large-scale matrix operations and data processing far more efficiently than traditional CPUs.
Their versatility and efficiency make them essential for tasks requiring high computational throughput, such as real-time rendering, deep learning, and large-scale data analysis.
