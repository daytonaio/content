title: "Product-Led Growth (PLG)"
description: "Product-Led Growth (PLG) is a go-to-market strategy characterized by heavy reliance on the product itself to generate user interest, drive adoption, and facilitate the sales process. This approach aims to reduce dependency on traditional marketing and sales tactics. PLG leverages the product's ability to fulfill user needs effectively, resulting in organic growth and user-driven dissemination. While PLG's success is well-documented in scenarios where end-users hold purchasing power, such as with consumer-focused products like Dropbox, it may present limitations for enterprise-focused products. Founders considering this strategy must thoughtfully evaluate customer behavior, align their product with those behaviors, and define long-term revenue objectives. In some cases, a pivot from PLG to a value-driven model that prioritizes customer relationships may be necessary to ensure sustainable growth and maintain relevance in a competitive marketplace."
