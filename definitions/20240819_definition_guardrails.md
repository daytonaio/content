# Guardrails

## Definition

Guardrails are constraints, guidelines, or architectural boundaries that help
steer developers towards an organization's recommended "Golden Path" or "Paved
Road" for building and running systems, while still allowing some flexibility.
They play a crucial role in ensuring that developers adhere to best practices,
follow security protocols, and meet compliance requirements.

Guardrails provide a set of predefined rules and standards that developers can
follow to avoid common pitfalls and deviations that could cause issues or
introduce vulnerabilities in the system. They help streamline the development
process by providing a clear path for developers to follow, reducing the chances
of errors and maximizing efficiency.

In addition to providing guidance, guardrails also offer visibility, monitoring,
and automation. They enable organizations to enforce best practices at scale,
rapidly validate changes, and identify potential issues or deviations before
they can cause significant problems. Guardrails provide organizations with the
ability to maintain safety and security while still moving quickly and
innovating.

By implementing guardrails, organizations can ensure that developers stay on
track and aligned with the organization's goals and standards. This not only
helps improve the quality and reliability of software systems but also enhances
collaboration and encourages a culture of compliance and best practices within
the development team.
