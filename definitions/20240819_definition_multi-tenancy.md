# Multi-tenancy

## Definition

An architecture principle where a single instance of a software application
serves multiple customers or "tenants." Each tenant's data is isolated and
remains invisible to other tenants.

Multi-tenancy is a fundamental concept in cloud computing and software
development. In a multi-tenant environment, a single instance of a software
application serves multiple customers or "tenants." This approach allows for
efficient resource utilization, as multiple tenants can share the same
infrastructure and software stack.

Under a multi-tenant architecture, each tenant's data is securely isolated from
other tenants, ensuring privacy and security. This isolation is achieved through
various techniques such as data segmentation, access controls, and encryption.
By separating tenant data, multi-tenancy provides an additional layer of
protection against data breaches and unauthorized access.

Furthermore, multi-tenancy enables scalability and flexibility. With a shared
infrastructure, resources can be dynamically allocated based on the needs of
each tenant. This approach allows for efficient resource utilization, reducing
costs and improving overall performance.

Overall, multi-tenancy offers an efficient and cost-effective way to serve
multiple customers on a shared software application. By providing secure data
isolation, scalability, and resource optimization, multi-tenant architectures
have become a popular choice for cloud-based services and applications.
