# Multi-tenancy

## Definition

An architecture principle where a single instance of a software application serves multiple customers or "tenants." Each tenant's data is isolated and remains invisible to other tenants.

Multi-tenancy is a fundamental concept in cloud computing and software development. In a multi-tenant environment, a single instance of a software application serves multiple customers or "tenants." This approach allows for efficient resource utilization, as multiple tenants can share the same infrastructure and software stack. 

Under a multi-tenant architecture, each tenant's data is securely isolated from other tenants, ensuring privacy and security. This isolation is achieved through various techniques such as data segmentation, access controls, and encryption. By separating tenant data, multi-tenancy provides an additional layer of protection against data breaches and unauthorized access.

Furthermore, multi-tenancy enables scalability and flexibility. With a shared infrastructure, resources can be dynamically allocated based on the needs of each tenant. This approach allows for efficient resource utilization, reducing costs and improving overall performance.

Overall, multi-tenancy offers an efficient and cost-effective way to serve multiple customers on a shared software application. By providing secure data isolation, scalability, and resource optimization, multi-tenant architectures have become a popular choice for cloud-based services and applications.
