# Configuration Drift

## Definition

Configuration drift refers to the phenomenon in which there is a gradual accumulation of unapproved or unintended changes to a system over time, leading to configuration inconsistencies and outdated settings. It is a common problem in software development environments where multiple developers work on a shared codebase or where different environments (e.g., development, staging, production) are not kept in sync.

When configuration drift occurs, it can result in various issues such as bugs, performance degradation, security vulnerabilities, and difficulties in reproducing and debugging issues. This drift can happen due to manual changes made by developers, software updates, system failures, or the lack of proper configuration management processes.

To mitigate configuration drift, organizations can implement practices such as version control for configuration files, automation of configuration provisioning and deployment, infrastructure-as-code approaches, and regular checks for inconsistencies and discrepancies between different environments. By maintaining consistency in the configuration settings across all stages of the software development lifecycle, teams can ensure smoother collaboration, faster deployments, and more reliable and secure systems.
