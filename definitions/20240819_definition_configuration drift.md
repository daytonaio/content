# Configuration Drift

## Definition

Configuration drift refers to the phenomenon in which there is a gradual
accumulation of unapproved or unintended changes to a system over time, leading
to configuration inconsistencies and outdated settings. It is a common problem
in software development environments where multiple developers work on a shared
codebase or where different environments (e.g., development, staging,
production) are not kept in sync.

When configuration drift occurs, it can result in various issues such as bugs,
performance degradation, security vulnerabilities, and difficulties in
reproducing and debugging issues. This drift can happen due to manual changes
made by developers, software updates, system failures, or the lack of proper
configuration management processes.

To mitigate configuration drift, organizations can implement practices such as
version control for configuration files, automation of configuration
provisioning and deployment, infrastructure-as-code approaches, and regular
checks for inconsistencies and discrepancies between different environments. By
maintaining consistency in the configuration settings across all stages of the
software development lifecycle, teams can ensure smoother collaboration, faster
deployments, and more reliable and secure systems.
