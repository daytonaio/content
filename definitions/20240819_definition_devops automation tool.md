# DevOps Automation Tool

## Definition

A DevOps automation tool is a software application or suite designed to automate
the processes involved in the delivery and operations of software development,
thereby enhancing efficiency and reducing the likelihood of human error.

These tools facilitate continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD)
pipelines, automate code deployment and infrastructure provisioning, and manage
the orchestration of complex application environments from code changes in a
repository to the final release and application or service upgrade.

The goal is to minimize manual intervention in the software delivery process,
thereby speeding up delivery cycles, reducing bottlenecks, and shortening
feedback loops for faster iterations and improvements in software products.

Using DevOps automation tools, teams can achieve more consistent and reliable
operational tasks and deployment processes, directly contributing to the overall
quality and competitiveness of the software delivered.
