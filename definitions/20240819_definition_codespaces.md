# Codespaces

## Definition

GitHub Codespaces is a cloud-based development environment integrated into
GitHub that enables developers to code, build, test, and debug applications
directly from their browser or through supported code editors like Visual Studio
Code.

By leveraging container technology, Codespaces provides a fully featured
development environment that can be spun up in seconds, offering immediate
access to a robust and customizable coding platform. It is designed to
streamline project onboarding, enable collaborative coding sessions, and
simplify the process of testing program code in a consistent yet isolated
development setting.

Codespaces support a wide range of programming languages and frameworks, and it
integrates deeply with GitHub workflows, making it a compelling solution for
individuals and teams looking to enhance their development velocity and
collaborate more efficiently on software projects.
