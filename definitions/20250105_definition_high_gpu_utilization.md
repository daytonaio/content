# High GPU Utilization

## Definition

High GPU utilization refers to a situation where a significant percentage
of a GPU's processing power is actively being used, often exceeding 85% or more.
This indicates that the GPU is working at or near its maximum capacity to perform
computational tasks. High utilization typically occurs during resource-intensive
activities like gaming, video rendering, 3D modeling, machine learning model training, or large-scale data processing.

## Context and Usage

In many scenarios, high GPU utilization is desirable as it means the hardware
is being used efficiently to complete tasks quickly. However, consistently
high utilization can also cause the GPU to generate more heat, consume more power,
and potentially throttle performance if temperature or power limits are reached.
Monitoring tools like NVIDIAâ€™s `nvidia-smi` helpassess utilization and ensure it
remains within safe and optimal ranges.
