# Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

## Definition

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the process of managing and provisioning
infrastructure through machine-readable definition files and scripts rather than
manual configuration. This practice enables automation and consistency in
managing infrastructure. It involves using configuration files, such as YAML or
JSON, to describe the desired state of infrastructure resources, such as
servers, networks, and storage, and using tools to deploy and manage these
resources automatically.

IaC provides several benefits in the development and deployment process of
software. Firstly, it allows for faster and more efficient provisioning of
infrastructure, reducing the time and effort required to set up and configure
environments. This promotes agility and speed in software development and
deployment.

Secondly, IaC enhances consistency and reproducibility in infrastructure
management. With infrastructure defined as code, teams can easily version and
track changes to infrastructure configurations, making it easier to collaborate
and ensure consistency across different environments.

Thirdly, IaC enables automation and simplifies the management of infrastructure
at scale. By defining infrastructure as code, organizations can leverage
automation tools and frameworks to automate the deployment, monitoring, and
management of infrastructure resources. This reduces the risk of human errors,
improves efficiency, and allows for more reliable and predictable infrastructure
management.

Overall, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) brings automation, consistency, and
scalability to infrastructure management, enabling organizations to streamline
their development and deployment processes. It promotes efficient collaboration,
reduces manual effort, and allows for more reliable and reproducible
infrastructure configurations.
