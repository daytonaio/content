description:
  'A virtual machine (VM) is an emulation of a computer system that runs
  programs like a physical computer, providing a secure, isolated, and flexible
  environment for various tasks. VMs are created and managed by a software layer
  called a hypervisor, which allows multiple VMs to operate on the same host
  machine. By leveraging technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, and Dev
  Containers, VMs provide scalability, security, cost-effectiveness, and
  flexibility, making them suitable for the unique needs of the B2B market in
  developing standardized development environments. The use of VMs in platforms
  like Daytona enables users to spend less time on configuration and more time
  on creating innovative solutions.'

# Virtual Machine (VM)

## Definition

A virtual machine (VM) is an emulation of a computer system that runs programs
like a physical computer, providing a secure, isolated, and flexible environment
for various tasks. VMs are created and managed by a software layer called a
hypervisor, which allows multiple VMs to operate on the same host machine. By
leveraging technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, and Dev Containers, VMs provide
scalability, security, cost-effectiveness, and flexibility, making them suitable
for the unique needs of the B2B market in developing standardized development
environments. The use of VMs in platforms like Daytona enables users to spend
less time on configuration and more time on creating innovative solutions.
