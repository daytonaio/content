title: "Virtual Machine (VM)"
description: "A virtual machine (VM) is an emulation of a computer system that runs programs like a physical computer, providing a secure, isolated, and flexible environment for various tasks. VMs are created and managed by a software layer called a hypervisor, which allows multiple VMs to operate on the same host machine. By leveraging technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, and Dev Containers, VMs provide scalability, security, cost-effectiveness, and flexibility, making them suitable for the unique needs of the B2B market in developing standardized development environments. The use of VMs in platforms like Daytona enables users to spend less time on configuration and more time on creating innovative solutions."

## Definition

A virtual machine (VM) is an emulation of a computer system that runs programs like a physical computer, providing a secure, isolated, and flexible environment for various tasks. VMs are created and managed by a software layer called a hypervisor, which allows multiple VMs to operate on the same host machine. By leveraging technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, and Dev Containers, VMs provide scalability, security, cost-effectiveness, and flexibility, making them suitable for the unique needs of the B2B market in developing standardized development environments. The use of VMs in platforms like Daytona enables users to spend less time on configuration and more time on creating innovative solutions.
