title: 'Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)'
description:
  "Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) refers to a cloud computing model where
  organizations can access and utilize virtualized infrastructure resources
  provided by a third-party provider. This model offers a flexible and scalable
  solution for businesses by offloading the responsibility of managing and
  maintaining physical hardware and infrastructure components. Users have the
  freedom to deploy and manage their applications, data, operating systems, and
  middleware on the virtualized infrastructure. They can choose the computing
  resources they need, including servers, storage, networking, and security
  features, from the IaaS provider's pool of resources. This eliminates the need
  for organizations to invest in expensive hardware and infrastructure upfront,
  allowing them to focus on their core business operations. With IaaS, users
  have control over their virtualized infrastructure without worrying about the
  underlying physical infrastructure, ensuring high availability, reliability,
  and performance to support their applications and services."
