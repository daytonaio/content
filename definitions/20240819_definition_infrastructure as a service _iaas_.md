title: "Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)"
description: "Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) refers to a cloud computing model where organizations can access and utilize virtualized infrastructure resources provided by a third-party provider. This model offers a flexible and scalable solution for businesses by offloading the responsibility of managing and maintaining physical hardware and infrastructure components. Users have the freedom to deploy and manage their applications, data, operating systems, and middleware on the virtualized infrastructure. They can choose the computing resources they need, including servers, storage, networking, and security features, from the IaaS provider's pool of resources. This eliminates the need for organizations to invest in expensive hardware and infrastructure upfront, allowing them to focus on their core business operations. With IaaS, users have control over their virtualized infrastructure without worrying about the underlying physical infrastructure, ensuring high availability, reliability, and performance to support their applications and services."
