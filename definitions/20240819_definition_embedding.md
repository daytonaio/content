description: "Embedding is the process of converting complex data, such as text, images, or URLs, into numerical representations (vectors) that capture the essential meaning of the data. This transformation allows for efficient processing, comparison, and retrieval by machine learning models and databases."

# Embedding

## Definition

Embedding refers to the process of transforming data into a numerical format (typically a vector) that captures the semantic meaning of the data in a way that can be understood and processed by machine learning models or databases. In simpler terms, embedding is a way of representing complex data, such as words, images, or URLs, in a structured numerical form.

## Context and Usage

Embeddings are widely used in various fields of data processing and machine learning, particularly in natural language processing (NLP) and recommendation systems. For example, in NLP, words or sentences are often transformed into embeddings that capture their meanings, allowing algorithms to perform tasks like sentiment analysis, translation, or information retrieval.

In the context of ChromaDB and browser history, embedding refers to converting each entry in your history (such as URLs and their associated metadata) into a vector. These vectors are then stored in a database, enabling efficient search and comparison. By embedding browser history, users can perform sophisticated searches, such as finding similar pages or filtering results by various criteria, using the numerical representations of their data.
