# Bash Script

## Definition

A bash script is a plain text file containing a sequence of commands for the
Bash shell, a command-line interpreter included in many Unix-based systems.
These scripts typically have a `.sh` extension and are used to automate tasks by
running multiple commands in a sequence, simplifying repetitive actions or
complex workflows. Bash scripts can encompass a variety of commands, from simple
file operations to complex logic involving loops, conditionals, and variable
manipulations.

In the context of setting up a remote development environment, a bash script can
be immensely valuable. For instance, when provisioning a Linux server for
development purposes, you might use a bash script to sequentially execute
commands to install necessary software like Docker, set up SSH keys for secure
connections, and configure security settings. This automation minimizes manual
errors and saves time, making the onboarding process smoother, especially when
dealing with environments on different machines. With Daytona, you can bring
your own dotfiles, including bash scripts, to customize your environment to your
liking.
