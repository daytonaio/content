  "Automated Provisioning refers to the streamlined process of automatically
  creating and configuring computing resources, such as servers, virtual
  machines, or containers, without the need for manual intervention. This method
  ensures efficient scaling and management of resources, eliminating the
  potential errors and time constraints associated with manual provisioning.
  Automated provisioning enables developers and IT teams to quickly and
  consistently provision the necessary infrastructure, removing the dependence
  on individual developer's machines or manual setups. By automating the
  provisioning process, organizations can minimize configuration
  inconsistencies, enhance collaboration, and accelerate software development
  and deployment workflows. Through the use of standardized development
  environments (SDEs) and automation tools, such as infrastructure-as-code and

# Automated Provisioning

## Definition

Automated Provisioning refers to the streamlined process of automatically
creating and configuring computing resources, such as servers, virtual machines,
or containers, without the need for manual intervention. This method ensures
efficient scaling and management of resources, eliminating the potential errors
and time constraints associated with manual provisioning. Automated provisioning
enables developers and IT teams to quickly and consistently provision the
necessary infrastructure, removing the dependence on individual developer's
machines or manual setups. By automating the provisioning process, organizations
can minimize configuration inconsistencies, enhance collaboration, and
accelerate software development and deployment workflows. Through the use of
standardized development environments (SDEs) and automation tools, such as
infrastructure-as-code and containerization technologies, automated provisioning
brings consistency, speed, and scalability to the creation and management of
computing resources, contributing to the overall efficiency and productivity of
software development processes.
