title: "Automated Provisioning"
description: "Automated Provisioning refers to the streamlined process of automatically creating and configuring computing resources, such as servers, virtual machines, or containers, without the need for manual intervention. This method ensures efficient scaling and management of resources, eliminating the potential errors and time constraints associated with manual provisioning. Automated provisioning enables developers and IT teams to quickly and consistently provision the necessary infrastructure, removing the dependence on individual developer's machines or manual setups. By automating the provisioning process, organizations can minimize configuration inconsistencies, enhance collaboration, and accelerate software development and deployment workflows. Through the use of standardized development environments (SDEs) and automation tools, such as infrastructure-as-code and containerization technologies, automated provisioning brings consistency, speed, and scalability to the creation and management of computing resources, contributing to the overall efficiency and productivity of software development processes."

# Automated Provisioning

## Definition

Automated Provisioning refers to the streamlined process of automatically creating and configuring computing resources, such as servers, virtual machines, or containers, without the need for manual intervention. This method ensures efficient scaling and management of resources, eliminating the potential errors and time constraints associated with manual provisioning. Automated provisioning enables developers and IT teams to quickly and consistently provision the necessary infrastructure, removing the dependence on individual developer's machines or manual setups. By automating the provisioning process, organizations can minimize configuration inconsistencies, enhance collaboration, and accelerate software development and deployment workflows. Through the use of standardized development environments (SDEs) and automation tools, such as infrastructure-as-code and containerization technologies, automated provisioning brings consistency, speed, and scalability to the creation and management of computing resources, contributing to the overall efficiency and productivity of software development processes.
