# Paved Road

## Definition

The term "Paved Road" refers to a recommended path for building and running
systems within an organization, with tooling and documentation provided by
central platform teams. It is less opinionated than a Golden Path and offers
fewer constraints on developers. The concept of Paved Road was popularized by
companies like Netflix, who provide a standardized set of tools, frameworks, and
services to developers.

The Paved Road acts as a guidance mechanism that enables developers to navigate
the complexities of the development process more easily. It offers a streamlined
and standardized onboarding experience, reducing the time and effort required to
start contributing to projects. While it provides recommendations and best
practices, it also allows developers the flexibility to innovate and find
solutions that suit specific problems.

By following the Paved Road, developers can benefit from the expertise and
experience of central platform teams, avoiding potential pitfalls and ensuring
consistency in the development process. It simplifies decision-making, reduces
fragmentation, and fosters collaboration among developers. The Paved Road also
facilitates faster onboarding for new hires, as it removes obstacles and
undifferentiated heavy lifting, allowing developers to focus on writing code and
delivering value.

Overall, the Paved Road provides a well-defined path that allows developers to
navigate the development lifecycle efficiently and effectively, ensuring
consistency, productivity, and satisfaction within an organization.
