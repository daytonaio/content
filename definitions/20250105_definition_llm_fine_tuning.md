# LLM fine-tuning

## Definition

LLM fine-tuning is the process of taking a pre-trained large language model
(LLM) and adjusting its weights on a specific dataset or task to improve its
performance for a particular application. This process involves training the
model on a smaller, domain-specific dataset, allowing it to adapt to specialized
language, terminology, or context that was not fully captured during the initial
training. Fine-tuning typically requires fewer computational resources than training from scratch, as the model leverages the general knowledge learned during its pre-training phase.

## Context and Usage

In context, LLM fine-tuning is widely used in natural language processing (NLP)
applications where a general-purpose language model needs to be tailored for
specific use cases. For example, a model fine-tuned on medical texts can become
more proficient at tasks like diagnosing, summarizing medical records, or answering
health-related questions. Similarly, fine-tuning can be applied to customer service
chatbots, legal document analysis, or sentiment analysis, allowing the model to understand
and generate text more relevant to the specific industry or domain. This technique helps improve performance in specialized tasks while reducing the time and resources needed for training.
