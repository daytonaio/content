# Ephemerality

## Definition

Ephemerality refers to the temporary and transient nature of an object, system, or process that exists only for a short duration. In the context of cloud development environments and software development, ephemeral environments are short-lived and disposable systems created on-demand for temporary use.

Cloud-based ephemeral environments, such as Dev Containers, offer developers pre-configured and isolated development environments that can be easily created, modified, and discarded as needed. These environments provide a clean and consistent workspace for development, eliminating the need for manual setup and ensuring that all developers have the same environment for consistent results.

The use of ephemeral environments in software development brings several benefits. It allows developers to start coding without the complexities of environment setup and ensures that each development session begins with a fresh and standardized environment. Ephemeral environments also enable scalability, as they can be easily duplicated and distributed across teams, allowing for efficient collaboration and increased productivity.

Overall, ephemeral environments play a crucial role in modern software development workflows, providing developers with flexibility, efficiency, and reproducibility in their development processes.
