# Browser-Based Development Environment

## Definition

A Browser-Based Development Environment is a subset of cloud development
environments that allows developers to access and manage their development
workspace through a web browser interface. These environments are designed to
streamline the development process by providing on-demand, pre-configured setups
that can be instantly spun up, enabling developers to quickly switch between
projects and languages, and collaborate in real-time with team members. As part
of the broader spectrum of Development Environment Management (DEM), these
browser-based setups offer flexibility, scalability, and improved cost
efficiency by utilizing pooled cloud resources.
