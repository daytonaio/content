# DevOps Stages

## Definition

DevOps Stages refer to the phases of a continuous software development lifecycle
that encompasses planning, coding, building, testing, releasing, deploying,
operating, and monitoring. These stages form a part of the broader DevOps
approach, which aims to unify software development (Dev) and software operation
(Ops) to facilitate a culture of collaboration and rapid iteration. In the
context of standardized development environments, DevOps Stages are supported by
automation, infrastructure as code (IaC), and consistent configurations to
enhance the flow of software delivery.
