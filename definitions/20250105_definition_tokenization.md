# Tokenization

## Definition

Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into smaller units,
called tokens, which can be individual words, subwords, characters, or
other meaningful segments. In natural language processing (NLP), tokenization
is a fundamental step that enables models to process and analyze text. Tokens
serve as the input to language models, allowing them to represent text in a
format suitable for computation.

## Context and Usage

Tokenization is crucial for preparing text data for machine learning tasks
such as training or using large language models (LLMs). For instance, models like
GPT use byte-pair encoding (BPE) or similar methods to tokenize input text before
processing it. Tokenization is also used in applications like sentiment analysis,
information retrieval, and text summarization to structure data effectively. By ensuring consistency and handling linguistic nuances, tokenization optimizes both the model's understanding and computational efficiency, making it a foundational step in NLP pipelines.
