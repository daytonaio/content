# Optimizing LLM Inference with GPU-Accelerated Docker Containers

## Introduction

[Large Language Models (LLMs)](/definitions/20240820_definition_large-language-model.md) such as GPT-2 and GPT-3 have significantly pushed the boundaries of [natural language processing (NLP)](/definitions/20240820_definition_natural-language-processing.md), enabling a wide range of applications from complex text generation to translation and summarization. However, deploying these models efficiently requires substantial computational power, particularly for tasks like real-time text generation. GPUs are indispensable for handling these operations effectively, and [containerization](/definitions/20240819_definition_containerization.md) offers a streamlined solution for managing and scaling such workloads.

This guide will take you through setting up and configuring [Docker](/definitions/20240819_definition_docker.md) containers specifically for GPU-accelerated tasks. We'll cover everything from initial setup to optimizing performance and troubleshooting common issues. By the end of this guide, you'll be equipped to deploy and manage [LLMs](/definitions/20240820_definition_large-language-model.md) in a GPU-enabled [containerized environment](/definitions/20240819_definition_containerization.md).

### TL;DR

If [Docker](/definitions/20240819_definition_docker.md) isn't already installed on your system, follow these steps:

```bash
# Update package lists and install Docker
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker.io
sudo systemctl start docker
```

### NVIDIA Container Toolkit Installation

The NVIDIA Container Toolkit is essential for enabling GPU support in [Docker](/definitions/20240819_definition_docker.md) containers. It provides the necessary libraries and tools to seamlessly access NVIDIA GPUs from within [Docker](/definitions/20240819_definition_docker.md) containers, allowing you to leverage GPU acceleration for your applications.

To enable GPU support in [Docker](/definitions/20240819_definition_docker.md) containers, you need to install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit:

```bash
# Configure the production repository
curl -fsSL https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/gpgkey | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg \
  && curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/stable/deb/nvidia-container-toolkit.list | \
    sed 's#deb https://#deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg] https://#g' | \
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-container-toolkit.list

# Install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-container-toolkit

# Configure the container runtime
sudo nvidia-ctk runtime configure --runtime=docker

# Restart Docker to apply changes
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

### Verify GPU Configuration

To verify that your [Docker](/definitions/20240819_definition_docker.md) setup can access the GPU, run the following command:

```bash
docker run --rm --gpus all nvidia/cuda:12.6.0-base-ubuntu24.04 nvidia-smi
```

If your setup is correct, the `nvidia-smi` command will display information about your GPU, confirming that the GPU is accessible inside [Docker](/definitions/20240819_definition_docker.md) containers.

## Running LLM Inference in a Docker Container

With your GPU-enabled [Docker](/definitions/20240819_definition_docker.md) environment ready, the next step is to develop a text generation script using an [LLM](/definitions/20240820_definition_large-language-model.md) and run it inside a [Docker](/definitions/20240819_definition_docker.md) container.

### Download the GPT-2 Model

To download the GPT-2 model and tokenizer, use the following script:

```python
# download.py

from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer

model_name = "gpt2"
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(model_name)
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model.save_pretrained("./gpt2_model")
tokenizer.save_pretrained("./gpt2_tokenizer")
```

This script downloads and saves the GPT-2 model and tokenizer.

Run the script with:

```bash
python3 download.py
```

You should see `gpt2_model` and `gpt2_tokenizer` directories.

### Create the Initial Script

Now, create a script to generate text using the downloaded GPT-2 model:

```python
# inference.py

import torch
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer

def generate_text(prompt, max_length=50):
    # Check if GPU is available and set device accordingly
    device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
    
    # Load downloaded GPT-2 model and tokenizer
    model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained("./gpt2_model")
    tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained("./gpt2_tokenizer", clean_up_tokenization_spaces=True)
    
    # Move model to the GPU
    model.to(device)

    # Encode the input prompt
    inputs = tokenizer.encode(prompt, return_tensors="pt").to(device)

    # Create attention mask
    attention_mask = torch.ones(inputs.shape, device=inputs.device)

    # Generate text
    outputs = model.generate(
        inputs,
        max_length=max_length, 
        attention_mask=attention_mask,
        pad_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id
    )

    # Decode the generated text
    return tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    prompt = "Once upon a time in a land far, far away"
    generated_text = generate_text(prompt)
    print(generated_text)
```

This script loads the model and tokenizer, performs text generation, and prints the output.

### Create a Docker Container with Dependencies

To run this script in a [Docker](/definitions/20240819_definition_docker.md) container, create a `Dockerfile` that includes all necessary dependencies, such as PyTorch and the Transformers library:

```Dockerfile
FROM nvidia/cuda:12.6.0-base-ubuntu24.04

# Install Pip
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    python3-pip \
    python3-dev \
    python3-venv

# Create virtual environment
RUN python3 -m venv workspace

# Install PyTorch and Transformers libraries
RUN /workspace/bin/pip install torch transformers

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /workspace

# Copy your script into the container
COPY inference.py /workspace

# Copy local GPT-2 model into the container
COPY ./gpt2_model /workspace/gpt2_model

# Copy local GPT-2 tokenizer into the container
COPY ./gpt2_tokenizer /workspace/gpt2_tokenizer

# Specify the command to run
CMD ["/workspace/bin/python", "inference.py"]
```

This `Dockerfile` sets up a GPU-enabled environment, installs Python and the necessary libraries, and copies the text generation script into the container.

### Build and Run the Docker Container

With your `Dockerfile` ready, build and run the container:

```bash
# Build the container
docker build -t llm-gpu .

# Run the container with GPU support
docker run --gpus all llm-gpu
```

### Output

Running the script should generate text similar to the following:

```
Once upon a time in a land far, far away, the world was a land of the dead, where the dead were buried, and the dead were buried. The dead were buried in the land of the dead, and the dead were buried in
```

As you may have noticed, the initial output is repetitive and low quality. We will fix this in the following sections.

## Implementing Advanced Text Generation Techniques

When generating text using [LLMs](/definitions/20240820_definition_large-language-model.md), advanced sampling methods can significantly improve the quality and diversity of the output. This section will introduce top-k sampling, nucleus sampling (top-p sampling), and temperature scaling.

### Top-k Sampling

Top-k sampling restricts the model's predictions to the top `k` most probable next words, reducing the likelihood of generating less coherent outputs.

### Nucleus Sampling (Top-p Sampling)

Nucleus sampling selects from the smallest set of words whose cumulative probability is greater than or equal to `p`. This method allows for more dynamic sampling, adapting the number of considered tokens based on context.

### Temperature Setting

The temperature parameter controls the randomness of predictions by scaling the logits before applying the softmax function. Lower temperatures produce more deterministic results, while higher temperatures introduce greater variability.

### Updated Script

Here's how to integrate these techniques into the text generation script:

```python
import torch
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer

def generate_text(prompt, max_length=50, top_k=50, top_p=0.9, temperature=0.8):
    # Check if GPU is available and set device accordingly
    device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
    
    # Load pre-trained GPT-2 model and tokenizer
    model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained("./gpt2_model")
    tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained("./gpt2_tokenizer", clean_up_tokenization_spaces=True)
    
    # Move model to the GPU
    model.to(device)

    # Encode the input prompt
    inputs = tokenizer.encode(prompt, return_tensors="pt").to(device)

    # Create attention mask
    attention_mask = torch.ones(inputs.shape, device=inputs.device)

    # Generate text with advanced sampling techniques
    outputs = model.generate(
        inputs,
        max_length=max_length, 
        attention_mask=attention_mask,
        pad_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id,
        do_sample=True,  # Enable sampling
        top_k=top_k,     # Top-k sampling
        top_p=top_p,     # Nucleus (top-p) sampling
        temperature=temperature  # Adjust temperature
    )

    # Decode the generated text
    return tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    prompt = "Once upon a time in a land far, far away"
    generated_text = generate_text(prompt)
    print(generated_text)
```

### Implementing These Techniques in Docker

To use the updated script in a [Docker](/definitions/20240819_definition_docker.md) container, replace the content of your `inference.py` script with the updated code and rebuild the container:

```bash
# Build the container
docker build -t llm-gpu .

# Run the container with GPU support
docker run --gpus all llm-gpu
```

### Output

The output should now be more coherent and varied. For instance:

```
Once upon a time in a land far, far away, they would be able to see through their mind, and understand their own thoughts. We should be ashamed of ourselves, but we must not be ashamed of ourselves. We can only see and feel
```

As you can see, this is much more interesting.

## Monitoring and Optimizing Performance

After running the script, it's crucial to monitor performance and optimize as needed. You can use `nvidia-smi` for real-time GPU monitoring and the Python `time` module for performance benchmarking.

### Monitoring GPU Utilization

To monitor real-time GPU usage, run:

```bash
nvidia-smi
```

### Benchmarking and Performance Tuning

To measure the script's execution time and evaluate GPU utilization, consider adding a benchmarking script:

```python
import time
import torch
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer

def generate_text(prompt, max_length=50, model_name='gpt2', top_k=50, top_p=0.9, temperature=0.8):
    device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
    model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(model_name)
    tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name, clean_up_tokenization_spaces=True)
    model.to(device)
    inputs = tokenizer.encode(prompt, return_tensors='pt').to(device)
    attention_mask = torch.ones(inputs.shape, device=inputs.device)

    start_time = time.time()
    outputs = model.generate(
        inputs,
        max_length=max_length, 
        attention_mask=attention_mask,
        pad_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id,
        do_sample=True,
        top_k=top_k,
        top_p=top_p,
        temperature=temperature
    )
    end_time = time.time()

    print(f"Time taken: {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds")
    return tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    prompt = "Once upon a time in a land far, far away"
    print(generate_text(prompt))
```

Running this script will help you assess the performance of your model and guide optimization efforts.

## Optimization and Troubleshooting

### Fine-Tuning Performance

To maximize GPU efficiency, consider the following optimizations:

- **Mixed Precision Inference**: Use mixed precision to reduce memory usage and boost performance.
- **Batch Size Optimization**: Experiment with different batch sizes to balance memory usage and processing speed.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

Even with a well-configured setup, issues can arise. Below are some common problems and their solutions:

1. GPU Access Issues

    - **Problem**: [Docker](/definitions/20240819_definition_docker.md) cannot access the GPU inside the container.
    - **Solution**: Ensure that the NVIDIA Container Toolkit is correctly installed and that you are using the `--gpus all` flag when running the container.

2. Out-of-Memory Errors

    - **Problem**: Out-of-memory (OOM) errors during inference.
    - **Solution**: Lower the `max_length` parameter or reduce batch sizes in your script. Consider using mixed precision to reduce memory usage.

3. Slow GPU Performance

    - **Problem**: Slow inference times despite using a GPU.
    - **Solution**: Verify that the script is utilizing the GPU by monitoring usage with `nvidia-smi`. If usage is low, optimize the script by adjusting sampling parameters, reducing model size, or increasing batch size within memory limits.
