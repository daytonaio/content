# Streamlining Data Science Workflows with Cookiecutter and Daytona

## Introduction

Have you ever felt like you're spending more time setting up projects than coding and analyzing data? You're not alone. Tools like [Cookiecutter Data Science](https://cookiecutter-data-science.drivendata.org/) and [Daytona](https://www.daytona.io/docs/about/what-is-daytona/) were created so that you don't have to create projects from scratch and reinvent the wheel each time you want to jump into a new project.

Cookiecutter gives you a solid starting point for your data science projects. On the other hand, Daytona ensures everyone on your team is working with the same tools and setup, no matter where they are. The [Dev Container feature](/definitions/20240910_definition_dev_container_feature.md) supported by Daytona makes sure your models work the same way in testing as they do in the real world, especially when you are working with a team. Essentially, these tools will make your life easier when it comes to deploying and scaling data science projects.

Now that you have the necessary tools installed, let's proceed with the step-by-step guide to add a Dev Container to your project.

## What are Dev Container Features?

Dev Container features are pre-built, shareable components that can be easily added to your development container. They allow you to modularize and customize your Dev Container setup, making adding tools, runtimes, or libraries to your environment easier.

Benefits of using Dev Container features include:
- Simplified configuration
- Improved consistency across team environments
- Easier maintenance and updates
- Flexibility to mix and match tools as needed

## Step-by-Step Guide to Adding Dev Container Features

### Step 1: Set Up Your Basic Dev Container

1. Create a `.devcontainer` folder in your project root.
2. Inside this folder, create a `devcontainer.json` file.

Here's a basic structure:

```json
{
    "name": "Python Data Science",
    "dockerFile": "Dockerfile",
    "settings": {
        "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "/usr/local/bin/python"
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Identify Needed Features

Consider what tools and libraries you need for your data science project. Common needs might include:
- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Data manipulation libraries (Pandas, NumPy)
- Version control (Git)
- Code quality tools (Black, Flake8)

### Step 3: Add Features to Your devcontainer.json

To add features, include a `features` object in your `devcontainer.json`:

```json
{
    "name": "Python Data Science",
    "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/python:3.12-bookworm",
    "features": {
        "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/python:1": {},
    },
    "settings": {
        "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "/usr/local/bin/python"
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Add VS Code Extensions

While not strictly part of Dev Container features, adding relevant VS Code extensions enhances your development experience:

```json
"extensions": [
    "ms-python.python",
    "ms-python.vscode-pylance"
]
```

### Step 5: Configure Settings

Adjust VS Code settings to match your preferences:

```json
"settings": {
    "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "/usr/local/bin/python",
    "python.linting.enabled": true,
    "python.linting.pylintEnabled": true
}
```

### Step 6: Add Post-Create Commands

If you need to run commands after the container is created (e.g., installing additional packages), use `postCreateCommand`:

```json
"postCreateCommand": "pip install -r requirements.txt"
```

Your `devcontainer.json` file should look like this:

```json
{
    "name": "Python Data Science",
    "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/python:3.12-bookworm",
    "features": {
        "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/python:1":  {},

    },
  "customizations": {
    "vscode": {
        "settings": {
            "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "/usr/local/bin/python",
            "python.linting.enabled": true,
            "python.linting.pylintEnabled": true
        },
        "extensions": [
            "ms-python.python",
             "ms-python.vscode-pylance"
        ]
    }
  },

    "postCreateCommand": "pip install -r requirements.txt"
}
```

### Step 7: Create a requirements file

At the root of your project, create a `requirements.txt` file. List any additional packages you want to include in your project (e.g., Flask) by adding the package names to the file. These packages will automatically be installed via the `postCreateCommand`.

### Step 8: Rebuild and Test

After making changes:
- Press F1 or Ctrl+Shift+P.
- Type and select **Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container**.
- Alternatively, click the blue button at the bottom-left corner of VS Code and select **Reopen in Container** from the modal.

VS Code will then build the container based on the configuration in your `devcontainer.json` file and open your project inside the container. This process might take a few minutes the first time, as it needs to download and set up the container environment.

Once the container is running, you can start coding and running your application within this isolated environment.

## Using Cookiecutter Data Science Feature in Daytona

Combining Cookiecutter Data Science with Daytona's Dev Container features creates a powerful synergy for data science workflows. This integration allows you to leverage the standardized project structure of Cookiecutter Data Science within the reproducible environment provided by Daytona's Dev Containers.

By using this feature, you'll be able to:

- Quickly set up a standardized data science project structure
- Ensure all team members are working with the same tools and dependencies
- Seamlessly switch between projects without worrying about conflicting environments

### Getting started

To use this feature in your Daytona cloud development environment, follow these steps:

- Install Daytona. You can follow these [installation steps](https://www.daytona.io/docs/installation/installation/) to install Daytona for your operating system.

- After you have successfully installed Daytona, start a new server and create a new [Daytona workspace](https://www.daytona.io/definitions/d/daytona-workspace).

```bash
daytona server
daytona create --code
```
The command above creates a new Daytona workspace and opens the workspace in VSCode.
When prompted to either enter a **custom Repository URL** or **Create from sample**, select the latter. Then select Python from the options of sample workspaces.

- Navigate to the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file and edit the file by adding a new feature.

```json
  "features": {
    "ghcr.io/bellatrick/feature-starter/cookiecutter:latest": {}
  }
```
The feature in the JSON file will install Cookiecutter Datascience into your workspace along with the required packages.

- Commit this file to your repository.

- Open the Command Palette (F1 or Ctrl+Shift+P). Type and select **Remote-Containers: Rebuild Container**.

- Once the workspace is rebuilt, you can use the `ccds` command to create a new data science project structure.

```bash
ccds
```

This will prompt you for project details and create a new data science project structure based on the `cookiecutter-data-science` template.

Note: If the `ccds` command is not recognized, try running `source /usr/local/bin/activate-cookiecutter-ds` first to activate the environment then run `ccds` again.

## Step 3: Confirmation

To confirm that you've successfully set up your Daytona workspace with Cookiecutter Data Science, follow these steps:

- In your workspace, run the `ccds` command. You should be prompted to enter project details.
- After entering the details, check that a new directory has been created with the specified project name.
- Navigate into the new directory and verify that it contains the standard Cookiecutter Data Science project structure, including folders like data, models, and notebooks.
- Try running a Python script or Jupyter Notebook within the new project structure to ensure necessary libraries are installed and functioning correctly.

If you can complete these steps without errors, you've successfully set up your Daytona workspace with Cookiecutter Data Science!
