# Streamlining Data Science Workflows with Cookiecutter and Daytona

## Introduction

Have you ever felt like you're spending more time setting up projects than actually coding and analyzing data? You're not alone. Tools like [Cookiecutter Data Science](https://cookiecutter-data-science.drivendata.org/) and Daytona were created so that you don't have to create projects from scratch and reinvent the wheel each time you want to jump into a new project.

Cookiecutter gives you a solid starting point for your data science projects. Daytona, on the other hand, ensures everyone on your team is working with the same tools and setup, no matter where they are. The [Dev Container feature](/definitions/20240910_definition_dev_container_feature.md) supported by Daytona makes sure your models work the same way in testing as they do in the real world, especially when you are working with a team. Essentially, these tools will make your life easier when it comes to deploying and scaling data science projects.

3. Install the Remote - Containers extension in VS Code:

    - Open VS Code
    - Go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X)
    - Search for "Remote - Containers"
    - Click "Install"

4. Download and install Git [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

5. Install the [latest version of python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) from their website.

Now that you have the necessary tools installed, let's proceed with the step-by-step guide to add a Dev Container to your project.

## What are Dev Container Features?

Dev container features are pre-built, shareable components that can be easily added to your development container. They allow you to modularize and customize your dev container setup, making it easier to add tools, runtimes, or libraries to your environment.

Benefits of using dev container features include:
- Simplified configuration
- Improved consistency across team environments
- Easier maintenance and updates
- Flexibility to mix and match tools as needed

## Step-by-Step Guide to Adding Dev Container Features

### Step 1: Set Up Your Basic Dev Container

1. Create a `.devcontainer` folder in your project root.
2. Inside this folder, create a `devcontainer.json` file.

Here's a basic structure:

```json
{
    "name": "Python Data Science",
    "dockerFile": "Dockerfile",
    "settings": {
        "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "/usr/local/bin/python"
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Identify Needed Features

Consider what tools and libraries you need for your data science project. Common needs might include:
- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Data manipulation libraries (Pandas, NumPy)
- Version control (Git)
- Code quality tools (Black, Flake8)

### Step 3: Add Features to Your devcontainer.json

To add features, include a `features` object in your `devcontainer.json`:

```json
{
    "name": "Python Data Science",
    "dockerFile": "Dockerfile",
    "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/python:3.12-bookworm",
    "features": {
        "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/python:1": {},
    },
    "settings": {
        "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "/usr/local/bin/python"
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Add VS Code Extensions

While not strictly part of dev container features, adding relevant VS Code extensions enhances your development experience:

```json
"extensions": [
    "ms-python.python",
    "ms-python.vscode-pylance"
]
```

### Step 5: Configure Settings

Adjust VS Code settings to match your preferences:

```json
"settings": {
    "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "/usr/local/bin/python",
    "python.linting.enabled": true,
    "python.linting.pylintEnabled": true
}
```

### Step 6: Add Post-Create Commands

If you need to run commands after the container is created (e.g., installing additional packages), use `postCreateCommand`:

```json
"postCreateCommand": "pip install -r requirements.txt"
```

Your `devcontainer.json` file should look like this:

```json
{
    "name": "Python Data Science",
    "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/python:3.12-bookworm",
    "features": {
        "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/python:1":  {},

    },
  "customizations": {
    "vscode": {
        "settings": {
            "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "/usr/local/bin/python",
            "python.linting.enabled": true,
            "python.linting.pylintEnabled": true
        },
        "extensions": [
            "ms-python.python",
             "ms-python.vscode-pylance"
        ]
    }
  },

    "postCreateCommand": "pip install -r requirements.txt"
}
```

### Step 7: Create a requirements file

At the root of your project, create a `requirements.txt` file. List any additional packages you want to include in your project (e.g., Flask) by adding the package names to the file. These packages will automatically be installed via the `postCreateCommand`.

### Step 8: Rebuild and Test

After making changes:
- Press F1 or Ctrl+Shift+P.
- Type and select Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container.
- Alternatively, click the blue button at the bottom-left corner of VS Code and select Reopen in Container from the modal.

VS Code will then build the container based on the configuration in your `devcontainer.json` file and open your project inside the container. This process might take a few minutes the first time, as it needs to download and set up the container environment.

Once the container is running, you can start coding and running your application within this isolated environment.

    "ghcr.io/bellatrick/feature-starter/cookiecutter:latest": {}
  }
```
The feature in the json file will install Cookiecutter Datascience into your workspace along with required packages.

- Commit this file to your repository.

- Open the Command Palette (F1 or Ctrl+Shift+P). Type and select **Remote-Containers: Rebuild Container**.

- Once the workspace is rebuilt, you can now use the `ccds` command to create a new data science project structure.

```bash
ccds
```

This will prompt you for project details and create a new data science project structure based on the cookiecutter-data-science template.

Note: If the `ccds` command is not recognized, try running `source /usr/local/bin/activate-cookiecutter-ds` first to activate the environment then run `ccds` again.

## Step 3: Confirmation

To confirm that you've successfully set up your Daytona workspace with Cookiecutter Data Science, follow these steps:

- In your workspace, run the `ccds` command. You should be prompted to enter project details.
- After entering the details, check that a new directory has been created with the project name you specified.
- Navigate into the new directory and verify that it contains the standard Cookiecutter Data Science project structure, including folders like data, models, and notebooks.
- Try running a Python script or Jupyter notebook within the new project structure to ensure that all necessary libraries are installed and functioning correctly.

If you can complete these steps without errors, you've successfully set up your Daytona workspace with Cookiecutter Data Science!
