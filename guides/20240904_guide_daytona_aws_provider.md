# Setting Up Daytona AWS Provider

## Introduction

The AWS Provider allows Daytona to create and manage workspace projects on Amazon EC2 instances. The provider integrates Daytona with AWS, enabling you to manage workspaces in a scalable and flexible cloud environment. To use the AWS Provider, you need an AWS programmatic access user with AmazonEC2FullAccess permissions. This policy grants the necessary permissions to manage EC2 instances, which is crucial for Daytona’s workspace project creation and management.

In this guide, we will walk you through the setup and configuration of the Daytona AWS Provider, as well as creating an IAM user with the necessary permissions.

### Prerequisites

To follow along with this guide, you should have:
- A basic understanding of [AWS](../definitions/20240904_definition_aws.md), [AWS IAM](../definitions/20240904_definition_aws_iam.md) and [EC2 Instances](../definitions/20240904_definition_ec2_instances.md). 
- Access to an AWS account with programmatic access and appropriate permissions.
- installed Daytona latest version [install from [here](https://www.daytona.io/docs/installation/installation/)]

**Note:** *[In this guide, Daytona v0.29.1 is used]*
 
### TL;DR

- Create an AWS IAM user with AmazonEC2FullAccess permissions.

- Install and configure the Daytona AWS Provider for managing EC2 workspaces.

- Set up AWS targets, including configuring access keys, instance type, region, and more.

- Troubleshooting tips for common issues like invalid AWS credentials, IAM permission errors, and EC2 instance launch failures.

## Step 1: Preparations

### Setting Up an AWS IAM User

Before configuring the Daytona AWS Provider, create an IAM user in AWS with programmatic access and assign the `AmazonEC2FullAccess` permission. This user will allow Daytona to manage EC2 instances. Follow the below steps to create

- **Step 1.1**: Go to the IAM Management Console.

  #### Step 2.3.3: Configure AWS target options

  You will be prompted to enter several configuration options specific to AWS. Daytona AWS Provider offers a range of target options that can be customized 
  according to your requirements. Here’s a detailed overview:

  - **Access Key Id**:
    
    Provide your Access Key Id you created for the user earlier.
    
    Note: If you left empty, Daytona will fetch it from the AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY environment variable.

  - **Device Name**:
    
    The device name for the volume. This is typically the root device name for specified AMI, you can either adjust this to your preferred values or press `Enter` 
    to accept the default options. Get list of device names [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/device_naming.html)
    
  - **Image Id**:
    
    The ID of the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to launch an instance. Default is ami-04a81a99f5ec58529. Click [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/finding-an-ami.html) to find AMI that meets your needs.

  - **Instance type**:

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting
While setting up and configuring the AWS Provider with Daytona, you may encounter some common issues. Below are troubleshooting tips to help resolve them:
1. **Problem:** Daytona Provider Errors

   **Solution:** If Daytona encounters errors while interacting with the AWS Provider, it could be due to bugs or limitations in the recent release. Checking the [Daytona AWS Provider GitHub repository](https://github.com/daytonaio/daytona-provider-aws) for any known issues or updates can help resolve these problems. Additionally, consider updating to the latest version if you're using an outdated release.

2. **Problem:** Invalid AWS Credentials

   **Solution:** If you encounter an error related to AWS credentials, double-check your `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key`. Ensure that these credentials are correct and have the necessary permissions.

3. **Problem:** Insufficient IAM Permissions

   **Solution:** If you encounter "Access Denied" errors, verify that the IAM user has the necessary permissions, such as AmazonEC2FullAccess. You can update the user’s permissions via the IAM Management Console by attaching the required policies or creating a custom policy with the needed permissions.

4. **Problem:** EC2 Instance Launch Failure

   **Solution:** This issue might occur due to incorrect instance type, AMI ID, or security group configurations. Ensure the AMI ID matches the region you are deploying to, and the instance type is supported in that region. Also, verify that the security group allows necessary inbound and outbound traffic.

5. **Problem:** Region-Specific Issues

   **Solution:** AWS services and resources availability can vary by region. If you face issues related to resource availability, check if the service or instance type is available in the selected region. You might need to switch to a different region where the resource is supported.


## Conclusion
