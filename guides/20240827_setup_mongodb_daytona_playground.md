# Setting Up a MongoDB Playground with Daytona

## Introduction
Developer playgrounds are isolated environments where developers can safely experiment, test code, and explore new technologies without impacting their main projects or production environments. They offer a controlled space for prototyping, learning, and debugging. While creating a basic developer playground is usually straightforward, the complexity increases with the level of customization and specific requirements. However, with the right tools and platforms, even more complex playgrounds can be made relatively easy to set up and manage. This is where Daytona shines. 

Daytona's Workspaces are isolated, meaning developers can experiment freely without the risk of affecting their main projects or production environments. This isolation is crucial for safe testing and debugging. Daytona. simplifies the management of development environments, making it easy to spin up, tear down, or share playgrounds. This convenience enhances productivity and collaboration among teams.

In this guide, you will find out how to build a playground using Daytona to set up a MongoDB environment. We will walk you through the steps to create a reproducible and isolated development workspace, configure it with MongoDB, and customize it to suit your project needs. Before getting started, make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) installed, an IDE like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/), and [Daytona](https://www.daytona.io/docs/installation/installation/) set up on your system. By the end of this guide, you'll have a fully functional MongoDB playground ready for testing, experimentation, and development.

## TL;DR

- Developer playgrounds are isolated environments where developers can safely experiment, test code, and explore new technologies without impacting their main projects.
- Developer playgrounds boost software development by providing a risk-free space to test, learn, and innovate without affecting main projects.
- Daytona simplifies setting up developer playgrounds by providing reproducible, isolated environments with easy management and flexible configuration options.

## Overview of MongoDB 
MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that is designed for storing and retrieving large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data. Unlike traditional relational databases (SQL databases) that store data in tables with fixed schemas (rows and columns), MongoDB stores data in a more flexible, JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON). You can find out more about MongoDB and its core features [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/)

## Overview of Daytona
Daytona is a platform that simplifies the development environment setup by offering dev environments for software developers. It enables users to create and share fully configured development environments, allowing for faster onboarding, collaboration, and consistent setups across teams.Daytona enables you to manage and deploy Workspaces, which are reproducible development environments built on standard OCI containers, and it includes native support for the Dev Container standard. The architecture of Daytona is designed to potentially support other configuration standards in the future, such as Dockerfiles, Docker Compose, Nix, and Devfile.

**Features of Daytona**
- **Pre-configured Environments**: You can create environments with all dependencies, tools, and configurations pre-installed, so developers can start coding immediately without having to spend time configuring their setups.
- **Collaborative Workspaces**:The platform enables team collaboration by allowing multiple developers to work on the same environment. This can be particularly useful for pair programming, code reviews, or troubleshooting.
- **Containerized Environments**:Each development environment can be containerized, ensuring that the setup is consistent, reproducible, and isolated from other environments. This helps avoid the common "works on my machine" problem.
- **Reverse Proxy Support**:Daytona integrates a reverse proxy allowing you to access a workspace on a public or restricted network.

## Setup a Daytona configuration for MongoDB

Here, you're going to create a dev container using a `devcontainer.json` file, a `Dockerfile` and a `docker-compose.yml` file. One of Daytona's remarkable qualities is the ability to a build a project image according to the dev container standard. You can find out more about Daytona Builders [here](https://www.daytona.io/docs/usage/builders/)
- **Step 1**: Create a new directory

    You will create a file directory with any name and move inside of it.

    ```bash
    mkdir daytona-mongodb-playground && cd daytona-mongodb-playground
    ```
- **Step 2**: Create a .devcontainer directory

    This is where your devcontainer.json and dockerfiles will live

    ```bash
    mkdir .devcontainer && cd .devcontainer
    ```

- **Step 3**: Create a `devcontainer.json` file
    
    You are going to create a `devcontainer.json` file with the following code. This is the configuration file for the dev environment specifying settings and dependencies.
    ```json
    {
    "name": "mongo Dev Container Playground",
    "dockerComposeFile": "docker-compose.yml",
	"service": "mongodb_playground",
    "workspaceFolder": "/workspaces/${localWorkspaceFolderBasename}",
    "forwardPorts": [27017],
    "customizations": {
		"vscode": {
			// Add the IDs of extensions you want installed when the container is created.
			"extensions": [
				"mongodb.mongodb-vscode"
			]
		}
	}
  }
  
    ```
    Let's breakdown the `devcontainer.json` file 
    - **name**: Specifies the name of the development environment.
    - **dockerComposeFile**: points to the `docker-compose.yml` file we are going to use
    - **service**: Refers to the service name in the `docker-compose.yml` file that represents the MongoDB container or environment to be used.
    - **workspaceFolder**:Maps the local workspace folder (where the code is stored) to the /`workspaces/` directory inside the container. The variable `${localWorkspaceFolderBasename}` automatically resolves to the name of the local workspace folder.
    - **forwardPorts**: Exposes MongoDB's default port (`27017`) so that it is accessible from the host system or other containers for interaction with the MongoDB service.
    - **customizations**:Allows customization of the development environment, specifically for VS Code.
    - **vscode**: Automatically installs the MongoDB extension for VS Code, enabling MongoDB-related features (e.g., interacting with MongoDB directly from VS Code).
     Declares a persistent volume for storing MongoDB data.
- **Step 4**: Create a `Dockerfile`
    
    You will create a `Dockerfile` in the same directory

    ```dockerfile
    FROM mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:focal
    RUN  sudo apt-get install -y gnupg wget curl
    RUN wget -qO - https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-4.4.asc | sudo apt-key add -
    RUN echo "deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu focal/mongodb-org/4.4 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-4.4.list
    RUN sudo apt-gUpdates the package list and installs MongoDB.et update && export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive \
    && sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org
    ```
    Let's breakdown this Dockerfile for you
    - `FROM mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:focal`:Uses the Microsoft DevContainers base image based on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa). This provides a standard environment for development containers.
    - `RUN sudo apt-get install -y gnupg wget curl`:These utilities are necessary for managing GPG keys and downloading files. `gnupg` is used for key management, while `wget` and `curl` are used for downloading files.
    - `RUN wget -qO - https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-4.4.asc | sudo apt-key add -`: Ensures that the packages from the MongoDB repository can be verified and trusted. The `-qO -` option makes `wget` output the file to stdout, which is then piped to `apt-key add` for key addition.
    - `RUN echo "deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu focal/mongodb-org/4.4 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-4.4.list`: Configures the system to use MongoDBâ€™s official repository for version 4.4. This allows `apt-get` to retrieve MongoDB packages for installation.
    - `RUN sudo apt-get update && export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive && sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org`: Updates the package list and installs MongoDB.

- **Step 5** Create a docker-compose.yml file:

    You are going to create `docker-compose.yml` file in the same directory

    ```yml
    version: '3.8'

    services:
        mongodb_playground:
            build:
                context: .
                dockerfile: Dockerfile
                volumes:
                    -../..:/workspaces:cached
                network_mode: service:db
                command: sleep infinity

        db:
            image: mongo:4.4
            restart: unless-stopped
            ports:
            - "27017:27017"
            volumes:
            - mongodb-data:/data/db
    volumes:
         mongodb-data:
    ```
    Let's breakdown the ``docker-compose.yml` file for you
    
    - **version**: Ensures compatibility with Docker Compose features and syntax defined in version 3.8.
    - **services**: Defines the containers (services) that will be run as part of this Compose setup.
    - **mongodb_playground**: Defines a service named `mongodb_playground`.
    - **context**: Sets the build context to the current directory.
    - **dockerfile**: Specifies the Dockerfile to use for building this service.
    - **volumes: ../..:/workspaces:cached**: Mounts a directory from the host (two levels up to /workspaces in the container. The cached option optimizes performance by indicating that changes in the host are less likely to affect the container.

    - **network_mode: service:db**: Allows mongodb_playground to communicate with the db container using the same network. This is useful for sharing network settings between containers.
    - **command: sleep infinity**: Keeps the container running indefinitely, preventing it from stopping after its initial command finishes. 
    - **db**: Defines a service named `db`.
    - **image: mongo:4.4**:Uses the official MongoDB image version 4.4.
    - **restart: unless-stopped**: Restarts the container unless it is explicitly stopped by the user. This helps ensure the MongoDB service remains available.
    - **ports**: Exposes MongoDBâ€™s default port for external access. This makes MongoDB accessible from the host machine.
    - **volumes**:
        - `mongodb-data:/data/db`: Mounts a named volume `mongodb-data` to /`data/db` in the container.

    - **volumes**: This volume is used by the db service to store its database files.

- **Step 6** Initialize,Commmit and Create a GitHub repository:
    You will initialize and commit the code in your current directory 

    ```bash
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "inital commit"
    ```
    After commiting your code you will push it to a remote repository of your choice.

    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/YOUR-DIRECTORY-NAME.git
    git branch -M main
    git push -u origin main
  ```
  
## Creating the MongoDB playground in Daytona

Here you are going to use Daytona to build the playground using Github as a Provider and open a workspace in VS Code. You should ensure `daytona` is installed on you machine before proceeding.

- **Step 1** Start the Daytona Server daemon :

    Execute the command provided below to start the `daytona` server daemon. when prompted to start the server in the current terminal session click `yes`
    ```bash
  daytona server
  ```
    

    Your output should look like the image below

    ![image of running daytona server](assets/20240827_setup_mongodb_daytona_playground_img_1.png) the container.
    
- **Step 2** Setup your Git Provider :

   Daytona integrates with your preferred Git provider, streamlining your workflow by allowing direct access to 
   repositories, and simplifying workspace creation from existing projects.
   Execute the command provided below to add your git provider. Github is one of the most popular developer 	 
   tools. Daytona also has support for other git providers like Bitbucker and Gitlab. You can learn more about 
   Daytona Providers [here]()

    ```bash
    daytona git-provider add
    ```
    Your output should be similar to the image below
    
    ![image of github provider](assets/20240827_setup_mongodb_daytona_playground_img_2.png)
    
    Select GitHub and provide your personal access token.

- **Step 3** Choose your preferred IDE :
     
    Run this command in terminal to choose your  [IDE](https://www.daytona.io/docs/usage/ide/).
     ```bash
    daytona ide
    ```
- **Step 4** Create a Daytona Workspace :
    
    Substitute the `USERNAME/REPO-NAME` from the code below with the Github username and the repository where the devcontainer is stored. 

  ```bash
  daytona create https://github.com/USERNAME/REPONAME
  ```
  Ideally but optional you should add the `--code` flag at the end. This will automatically open your preferred editor after building the devcontainer

  ```bash
  daytona create https://github.com/USERNAME/REPONAME --code
  ```
    Your output before your IDE opens should be similar to these images

# Interacting with the MongoDB playground using Mongo Shell.

Your Preferred IDE should have opened up, you will be instructed to open a Remote SSH connection.You should see that your `devcontainer.json`, `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` files have been downloaded.Navigate to your terminal after creating the connection by clicking `Ctrl + Shift + ` ` . In the terminal execute the following code to start a mongo shell and carry out operations in .

	```bash
 	mongo
 	```
    
- **Step 1** Create a MongoDB Database: 

    ```bash
        use test
    ```


- **Step 2** Create MongoDB Collection:

     ```bash
     db.createCollection("collection")
    ```

- **Step 3**: Create a document into test collection:

  ```bash
  db.collection.insertOne({ name: "John", age: 25, city: "New York" });
  ```
  Your output should look like the image below
  
  ![image of creating a document](assets/20240827_setup_mongodb_daytona_playground_img_6.png)

- **Step 4**: Read (Query) a document from the collection:
    ```bash
    db.collection.findOne({ name: "John" })
    ```
    Your output should look like the image below

    ![image of reading a document](assets/20240827_setup_mongodb_daytona_playground_img_7.png)

- **Step 5**: Update a document:
    ```bash
    db.collection.updateOne(
    { name: "John" },  // Filter
    { $set: { age: 26 } }  // Update operation
    );
    ```
    Your output should look like the image below
  
  ![image of updating a document](assets/20240827_setup_mongodb_daytona_playground_img_8.png)

- **Step 6**: Delete the Collection
    ```bash
    db.collection.deleteOne({ name: "John" });
    ```
    Your output should look like the image below
    
    ![image of deleting a document](assets/20240827_setup_mongodb_daytona_playground_img_9.png)

## Using the MongoDB playground extension (Optional)

Alternatively you can use the official MongoDB extensions playground since you provided `"mongodb.mongodb-vscode"` as a extension in the `devcontainer.json` file.

- **Step 1** Create a connection:

    Click on the **Connect to MongoDB** in the MongoDB view, then enter the connection string below 

    ```bash
    mongodb://localhost:27017
    ```
- **Step 2** Connect to Playground:

    Connect to the MongoDB playground, which is a built-in interactive environment for running MongoDB queries. Navigate to the MongoDB extension and click on the **Create MongoDB Playground**. 

- **Step 3** Run Queries :
    Inside the playground you can write queries just like you did in the MongoDB Shell. For example

    ```javascript
    use("test");
    db.collection.insertOne({name:'Eliza',age:40})
    ```
    You should get the same output below
    
    ![image of mongodb vscode extension](assets/20240827_setup_mongodb_daytona_playground_img_10.png)

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

**Connection Refused on Port 3896**: If you are experiencing this, check what service is running on that port and close it. Check out how to find and close a port connection [here](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/unix-linux-check-if-port-is-in-use-command/)

**Cannot Start the Daytona Docker Registry**: If you cant start the Daytona Docker registry don't panic, just re-run the `daytona create` command and it should run as expected.

**IDE doesn't open after building Workspace** : If your IDE doesnt start immediately after building the devcontainer, open your terminal and type the `daytona list` command,select your running workspace and you're good to go.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, by following this guide, you've successfully set up a MongoDB playground using Daytona. With a reproducible and isolated environment at your disposal, you can now experiment, test, and develop, knowing your main projects remain unaffected. This setup not only streamlines your workflow but also allows you to explore new ideas and technologies.
