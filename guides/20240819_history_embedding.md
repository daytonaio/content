# Embedding and Searching Browser History with ChromaDB

## Introduction

[Embedding](/definitions/d/embedding) your browser history using ChromaDB allows you to transform vast amounts of web activity data into structured, searchable formats. By converting URLs and their associated metadata into numerical representations known as [embedding](/definitions/d/embedding)s, you can efficiently search, filter, and analyze your browsing history. This guide walks you through the process of setting up a development environment, [embedding](/definitions/d/embedding) your browser history, and conducting advanced searches using ChromaDB, whether you’re leveraging a local model or the power of Azure’s cloud-based [embedding](/definitions/d/embedding) services.

This guide is designed for users who want to gain deeper insights into their browsing habits or need a more powerful way to sift through large amounts of history data. From setting up the necessary tools to executing detailed search queries with various filters, you'll gain the knowledge to fully utilize ChromaDB’s capabilities. Whether you’re a developer looking to integrate this functionality into a larger project or simply someone who wants to better manage their digital footprint, these step-by-step instructions will help you achieve your goals.

### TL;DR

- **Export Browser History**: Use the Export Chrome History extension to get a CSV file.
- **Set Up Environment**: Install Daytona and create a [workspace](/definitions/d/daytona-workspace).
- **Embed History**: Run the `search.py` script to embed your history data.
- **Search History**: Perform searches using various filters and options.

## Preparations

### Installing Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have [Daytona](https://github.com/daytonaio/daytona) installed.

You can install Daytona by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -L https://download.daytona.io/daytona/install.sh | sudo bash
```

Daytona creates a controlled [development environment](/definitions/d/development-environment) where you can work on the project with all dependencies correctly configured, reducing the likelihood of compatibility issues.

### Exporting Browser History

To work with your browser history, you'll need to export it from your browser:

1. **Install the Export Chrome History Extension**: Download and install the [Export Chrome History](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/export-chrome-history/) Chrome extension.
2. **Export to CSV**: Use the extension to export your browser history as a CSV file. Save it to a convenient location, like `~/Downloads/history.csv`.

Example CSV snippet:

```csv
visit_time,url,title,visit_count,typed_count
2023-08-10 12:34:56,http://example.com,Example Site,5,2
2023-08-09 11:22:33,http://anotherexample.com,Another Example,3,1
```

## Setting Up the Development Environment

### Creating a Daytona Workspace

With Daytona installed, you can create a [workspace](/definitions/d/daytona-workspace) for the [`nkkko/history` repository](https://github.com/nkkko/history):

```bash
daytona create https://github.com/nkkko/history --code
```

This command clones the [repository](/definitions/r/repository) and sets up the necessary environment. Daytona manages dependencies and configurations, ensuring that your environment is set up correctly for running the project scripts.

### Set Up Environment Variables (Optional for Azure)

If you plan to use Azure's [embedding](/definitions/d/embedding) services instead of the local model, you need to configure the environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the [repository](/definitions/r/repository) and add the following:

```env
AZURE_API_VERSION=<your_azure_api_version>
AZURE_ENDPOINT=<your_azure_endpoint>
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_azure_api_key>
```

**Example**:
```env
AZURE_API_VERSION=2021-06-01-preview
AZURE_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com/
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-secret-key
```

**Why Azure?**  
Using Azure's [embedding](/definitions/d/embedding) service can be beneficial if you need higher performance or better semantic accuracy in your [embedding](/definitions/d/embedding)s, especially when dealing with large datasets.

## Embedding and Searching Your Browser History

### Embedding

With your [development environment](/definitions/d/development-environment) ready, you can now embed your browser history into ChromaDB.

To embed using the local model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2), run:

```bash
python search.py --embed path/to/your/history.csv
```

**Practical Example**:
If your history CSV is located at `~/Downloads/history.csv`, the command would be:

```bash
python search.py --embed ~/Downloads/history.csv
```

This command reads each entry from the CSV, processes it into an [embedding](/definitions/d/embedding), and stores it in ChromaDB. The local model `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` is lightweight and works well for most purposes.

**Using Azure [Embedding](/definitions/d/embedding)s**:
If you’re leveraging Azure for [embedding](/definitions/d/embedding)s, use the `--azure` flag:

```bash
python search.py --embed ~/Downloads/history.csv --azure
```

### Searching

Once your history is embedded, you can perform searches using the `search.py` script. Here's how to use it effectively:

```bash
python search.py "search query"
```

#### Refining Searches

When searching your embedded browser history, using filters can help you narrow down results and make your searches more effective:

1. **Domain (`--domain`)**: Restrict results to a specific website. Useful when you remember the site but not the exact URL.
   - *Example*: `python search.py "article title" --domain example.com`

2. **Newest (`--newest`)**: Sort results by the most recent entries. Ideal for finding pages you visited recently.
   - *Example*: `python search.py "recent topic" --newest`

3. **Visit Count (`--visit-count`)**: Filter results by a minimum number of visits. Helps focus on frequently visited pages.
   - *Example*: `python search.py "important page" --visit-count 5`

4. **Typed Count (`--typed-count`)**: Filter by how often you manually typed the URL. Targets pages you intentionally visited.
   - *Example*: `python search.py "favorite site" --typed-count 3`

5. **Transition Type (`--transition`)**: Filter by how you arrived at a URL (e.g., link, typed, reload). Useful for distinguishing between different browsing actions.
   - *Example*: `python search.py "specific content" --transition typed`

**Comprehensive Example**:
```bash
python search.py "search query" --domain example.com --newest --visit-count 5 --typed-count 2 --transition typed
```

#### Practical Scenario

Imagine you frequently visit a research site. You want to find the latest article you visited on that site. You would run:

```bash
python search.py "latest research" --domain researchsite.com --newest
```
