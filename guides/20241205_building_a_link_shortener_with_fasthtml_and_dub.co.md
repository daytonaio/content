# Introduction
Development environments reamains an important part of development. Developers need environment to experiment new ideas, debug them without imparting existing products. When working on web applications, the ability to rapidly prototype, isolate dependencies, and integrate APIs seamlessly can make a significant difference.


This guide focuses on Daytona, a powerful tool for managing development environments. Daytona excels in providing isolated, containerized workspaces that ensure consistency, reduce setup overhead, and make it easy to collaborate across teams. By leveraging Daytona, developers can streamline their workflows, eliminate common configuration issues, and focus more on building impactful solutions.

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to set up a robust link shortener using FastHTML, a Python library for server-rendered applications, and the Dub.co API, a service for creating and managing shortened links. Readers will gain hands-on experience in:
Configuring a Daytona workspace
Building a landing page with FastHTML
Integrating external APIs
Deploying the finished application to production

Before diving in, ensure you have Daytona installed, Docker running ,Python 3.10 or later available
Basic familiarity with Python and web development concepts will be helpful but is not strictly required. Let's get started!


# TL;DR
Daytona Setup: Learn how to configure a Daytona workspace for isolated and efficient development.
FastHTML Integration: Build a landing page using FastHTML, ensuring clean and responsive server-rendered output.
Dub.co API Integration: Incorporate external API calls to generate and manage shortened links.
Deployment: Deploy the final application to a production-ready environment like Render.
