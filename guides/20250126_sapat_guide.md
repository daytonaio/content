## Prerequisites

Before using Sapat, ensure you have the following:  

- **Python 3.6+** installed on your system.

- **ffmpeg** installed and added to your system's PATH.

- **API access** for one or more supported services:
  - Azure OpenAI  
  - Groq Cloud  
  - OpenAI

- A valid `.env` file with your API credentials.  

## What's Sapat?  

Sapat (Synthesizing Audio Processing and Transcription Technology) is an automation tool designed to transcribe video and audio files into text using state-of-the-art AI models. By supporting multiple APIs, it gives users flexibility and reliability in generating transcriptions quickly and accurately.  

## Features

- **Video-to-Audio Conversion**: Converts video files into MP3 format using ffmpeg for transcription.

- **Multi-API Support**: Works with Azure OpenAI, Groq, and OpenAI APIs.

- **Batch Processing**: Handles individual files or entire directories for transcription.

- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust language, audio quality, temperature, and prompts to guide transcription models.

- **Temporary File Cleanup**: Automatically removes intermediate MP3 files after transcription.

## How It Works  

1. **Input File**: Sapat accepts video or audio files as input.

2. **Audio Conversion**: Videos are converted to MP3 format using ffmpeg.

3. **API Transcription**: The audio file is sent to the selected API for transcription.

4. **Output**: The transcription is saved as a `.txt` file in the same directory as the input file.

5. **Cleanup**: Temporary files (e.g., MP3) are deleted after transcription.

## How to Transcribe a Video File with Sapat  

1. **Prepare the Environment**:  
   - Ensure the `.env` file is configured with your API credentials.  
   - Install Sapat by following the installation steps in the README.  

2. **Run the Transcription Command**:  
   ```bash
   sapat my_video.mp4 --quality H --language en --api openai
   ```  
   - Replace `my_video.mp4` with your video file.  
   - Use the `--quality` option to set MP3 quality (`L`, `M`, `H`).  

3. **View Results**:  
   - A file named `my_video.txt` will be created in the same directory as the video file, containing the transcription.  


## How to Transcribe an Audio File with Sapat

1. **Run the Transcription Command**:  
   ```bash
   sapat my_audio.mp3 --language es --api azure --prompt "Focus on technical terms"
   ```  
   - Replace `my_audio.mp3` with your audio file.  
   - Add a `--prompt` to guide the transcription model if needed.  

2. **Output**:  
   - The transcription will be saved as `my_audio.txt` in the same directory.  

## Tips and Best Practices  

- **Choose the Right API**: Use the API that suits your transcription needs:  
  - Azure OpenAI for enterprise solutions.  
  - Groq for faster processing.  
  - OpenAI for general transcription.

- **Optimize Audio Quality**: For best results, use high-quality audio (`--quality H`).

- **Leverage Prompts**: Provide a `--prompt` to guide the transcription model for specific contexts or terminology.

- **Batch Process**: Save time by processing an entire directory instead of individual files.

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting  

### Issue: Missing `.env` File  

**Solution**: Ensure the `.env` file is in the project root and contains valid API credentials.  

### Issue: ffmpeg Not Found  

**Solution**: Install ffmpeg and add it to your system PATH. Verify the installation by running `ffmpeg -version` in your terminal.  

### Issue: API Errors

- **Rate Limits**: Ensure your API account has sufficient credits or quotas.

- **Invalid Keys**: Double-check your API keys in the `.env` file.

### Issue: Poor Transcription Accuracy

**Solution**:  
- Use a clearer audio source.  
- Specify the correct language using the `--language` option.  
- Provide a contextual `--prompt` to improve transcription quality.  

## Conclusion  

Sapat is a powerful tool that simplifies the transcription of video and audio files using leading AI services. By following this guide, you can set up Sapat, transcribe files with ease, and troubleshoot common issues.
