## Role of a Reviewer

As a reviewer, your primary responsibilities include:

  guidelines.
- Providing constructive feedback to authors to help improve their
  contributions.
- Ensuring consistency and alignment with the Daytona Content Programme's
  standards.
- Facilitating the smooth publication of high-quality content.

## Reviewing Process

1. **Assignment**: Reviewers are assigned to pull requests (PRs) based on their
   expertise and availability.
2. **Initial Assessment**: Conduct a preliminary review to check for
   completeness and basic adherence to submission guidelines.
3. **Detailed Review**: Evaluate the content in-depth, focusing on quality,
   accuracy, and replicability.
4. **Feedback Provision**: Leave detailed comments and suggestions for
   improvement.
5. **Final Assessment**: After revisions, perform a final check to ensure all
   feedback has been addressed.
6. **Approval**: Approve the PR for merging if it meets all standards.

## Review Guidelines

### Content Quality

- **Relevance**: Ensure the content is relevant to the Daytona ecosystem and
  aligns with the programme's objectives.
- **Originality**: Verify that the content is original and free from plagiarism.
- **Depth**: Check that the content provides comprehensive coverage of the
  topic, offering valuable insights and information.

### Replicability and Accuracy

- **Replicability**: For how-to articles and guides, ensure that all steps are
  clear, complete, and can be followed by the reader without confusion. Test the
  instructions yourself if possible.
- **Accuracy**: Verify that all factual information is correct. Cross-check data
  points, statistics, and references to ensure their validity.
- **References**: Ensure that all claims are supported by reliable sources and
  that references are properly cited.

### Adherence to Guidelines

  [Contributing.md](https://github.com/daytonaio/content/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
  guidelines. Avoid repeating instructions here; instead, reference the relevant
  sections.
- **Naming Conventions and Formatting**: Confirm that naming conventions and
  formatting follow the established standards as outlined in the
  [Contributing.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Approval and Merging

Once a PR meets all the review criteria:

## Handling Revisions

If a PR requires revisions:

2. **Detail Required Revisions**: Clearly outline what needs to be addressed.
3. **Monitor Progress**: Keep track of the revisions and provide additional
   feedback if necessary.

   issues are resolved.

## Conflict Resolution

In cases of disagreements or conflicts during the review process:

1. **Open Communication**: Encourage open and respectful dialogue between the
   reviewer and the author.
2. **Seek Consensus**: Aim to reach a mutual agreement on necessary changes.
