Author: Varun Seenivasan Title: Software Engineer Description: I am a solo developer who is currently studying information systems in my first year of college. I have been studyinhg computer science since I was 9 years old and took 4 years of computer science classes in high school. I am very passionate about coding and it is one of my favorite pastimes. I hope to one day work for a software company. I am interested in working on indie-dev projects and have a few ideas for a project of that variety of my own. I currently am attempting to solve coding bounties and secure small software contracts on websites like Upwork.com. It is going pretty slow but with some determination, I am sure I will get some momentum soon. I look forward to contributing to the Daytona project and working along side the Daytona developers.
